At the very least, they'd be able to answer your questions.

Re the methodology, the main issue would be copyright. I'm not sure how long the copyright on comic strips lasts, and whether it can be renewed. If they've fallen out of copyright, it's almost certain someone has archived them. You might take a look at https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ which has old scanned newspapers, but I'm not sure if they include comic strips. I believe you can even mass download their data, but I think I tried it and got bored and/or ran out of storage",
