Historically, there have been many paradoxes in mathematics: Zeno ""proved"" motion was impossible, Russell created a set that was both inside and outside another set, and so on.

Mathematicians eventually decided to formalize set theory to avoid these paradoxes, but there's no guarantee they have. There might be another paradox lurking that could, in theory, invalidate existing proofs.

Godels Incompleteness Theorem tells us no deductive system that contains multiplication can be both complete and consistent. That means either our current set of axioms (and axiom schema) can't assign a true or false value to every proposition (this part is known to be true) or will eventually show true = false, rendering proofs meaningless until we resolve the issue, or both.",

Not exactly. On a PDF, the number of samples at a given exact value is always 0, because you're looking at a single real number, and there's 0% chance that a sample has a specific real value (0% in the sense of probability distributions, without getting to philosophical).

Instead, you can use the PDF to determine how many samples occur between two values by integrating the PDF. For example, if you wanted to know the percentage of people between 40 and 50 at the time the sample was taken, you'd integrate the PDF from 40 to 50. Note that the result is a percentage (between 0 and 1), not the number of people between 40 and 50.

So, since we're not counting samples, how can a PDF go above 1? Easy: consider the PDF that's equal to 1 million between 0 and 10^-6, and 0 elsewhere. No matter what portion of this function you integrate, you'll always gets a number between 0 and 1, even though the PDF has a very high max value.

In general, the PDF's ""amplitude"" is chosen so that the PDF integrates out to 1, which it must. However, this doesn't mean that portions of the PDF can have values higher than 1",

Well, it would be:

`f(p) = Binomial[1000,600]*p^600*(1-p)^400`

where `Binomial` is the binomial coefficient.

Note that this gives you the relative likelihood that p is the correct probability, not the absolute likelihood that p is the correct likelihood (I'm using the word 'likelihood' interchangeably with 'probability' to try to make things easier to read)

For example, `f[0.60] = 0.0257448` and `f[0.55] = 0.000157966`, so it's `f[0.60]/f[0.55] ~ 163` times more likely that the actual probability is 0.6 than that the actual probability is 0.55

If we integrate f(p) between 0 and 1, we get 1/1001 instead of 1. That's not surprising since we're only measuring relative likelihood, not absolute. To turn this into a probability distribution, we multiply by 1001 to get:

`g(p) = 1001*Binomial[1000,600]*p^600*(1-p)^400`

as your probability distribution function.

We can now integrate g(p) between 0.55 and 0.65 to find the likelihood that the actual probability is between those two values is about 0.998783

Since `a` is rational, it can be written as `p/q` and raising both sides the 2q power yields `e^(2*pi*p) = (cos(pi*a) + I sin(pi*a))^(2q)` or `1 = (cos(pi*a) + I sin(pi*a))^(2q)` since p is an integer. The right side is a polynomial because 2q is an integer. You can then collect I terms to get the value of sin(pi*a) since the number of I terms on the left is 0

You could try something like:

If `n` is odd, then `3n+1` is `odd*odd + odd = odd + odd = even`, so the next number will be `(3n+1)/2`. Now, despite the `/2`, there's no way to know if `(3n+1)/2` is odd or even, since it may have other powers of 2. You can then choose the number `k` that makes `(3n+1)/2^k` odd.

You can then repeat the `3n+1` step to get `1 + (3 + 9n)/2^k` (after simplification). The numerator is `odd + odd*odd` -> `odd + odd` -> `even`. However, we don't know how many powers of 2 appear in `3 + 9n`. We know it must be AT LEAST k since the result is a natural number, but it could be more.

Therefore, we don't know if `(3+9n)/2^k` is even or odd, and thus don't know if `1+ (3+9n)/2^k` is even or odd. We can divide out all powers of two by dividing by 2^j where j could be 0 if the number if already odd.

This gives us `(1 + (3+9n)/2^k)/2^j`. Since this is odd, we apply `3n+1` again to get `1 + 3/2^j + 9*2^(-j - k) + 27*2^(-j - k)*n`.

You're absolutely correct. Since the groups of two are identical, each combination is counted twice in the calculation. Thus, we need to divide the total number of combinations by 2 to correct for this overcounting.

You could try asking fast food places that, but the person answering the phone probably won't know or won't tell you. Additionally, the exact amount will vary even in the same fast food place because not all small fries are filled identically.

Assuming a uniform distribution, if you bid x, the chance that your bid is greater than the valuation is `x`. If you succeed, we know the actual valuation is between 0 and x, and will have an average of `x/2`. Since the valuation triples after purchase your average profit is `3x/2-x`, the new value of the company, `3x/2` minus your purchase price.

Your expected value is therefore `x(3x/2-x) = x^2/2`, which is maximal when x=1

So it's roughly 3 times more likely that event A didn't occur than that it did. More specifically, the probability is the ratio of A occurring to the sum of the probabilities or `33.6%/(100%+33.6%) ~ 25.15%`.

Answering this simpler question:

  - If A did not occur, there is an 100% chance T would not be there

  - If A did occur, there's an 80% chance T would not be there.

So, if T is not there, it's 100/80 as likely A did not occur, and that ratio translates to `100/(100+80) ~ 55.56%`. However, I believe this assumes A is 50% likely to happen. If we know A occurs frequently or infrequently, this would change.",

If the probabilities were equal, you'd have a trivial argument showing the chances are 50%

Since the probabilities aren't equal, you'd have to pair a given string where 'b' wins with a given string where 'a' wins (perhaps the string with the a's and b's flipped) and compute how more likely the 'b wins' string is to the 'a wins' string.

Otherwise `A` would've already won earlier.

`A` can win in any of the following ways (where `Binomial[n,k]` is the binomial coefficient):

  - win 10 games straight, `p = (1/3)^10`

  - win 9 of the first 10 games and then win the 11th game, `p = Binomial[10,9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)*(1/3)`

  - win 9 of 11 games and then win the 12th game, `p = Binomial[11,9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)^2*(1/3)`

  - general case: win 9 of the first 10+n-1 games and then win the (10+n)th game: `p = Binomial[10+n-1, 9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)^n*(1/3)`

The n above starts at n = 0, winning 9 of the first 9 games and then also winning the 10th game (same as 10 in a row) and goes to n = 9, win 9 of the first 18 games and then win the 19th game. Note that if n = 10, winning the first 9 of 19 games would mean losing 10 of those 19 games, so `B` would win.

The answer is thus:

`Sum[Binomial[10+n-1, 9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)^n*(1/3), {n, 0, 9}]`

which is 75275227/1162261467 or about 6.477%

  - If you roll ndm (an m-sided die n times) for n > 1, the result is roughly a normal distribution with mean `n*(1+m)/2` and variance `n*((-1 + m)*(1 + m))/12`. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

  - Using the above, you could approximate the CDF of getting a value (say, 18) by looking at the CDF evalutaed at value minus 0.5 (say, 17.5), the one half to compensate for continuity.

  - You could then find the PDF by taking the finite differences of the CDF.

The powers of 2 mod 25 (including 2^0 = 1) follow the 20-element cycle `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 7, 14, 3, 6, 12, 24, 23, 21, 17, 9, 18, 11, 22, 19, 13`, where `2^10 = 1024 (mod 25) = 24`. Thus, n must be of the form `10 + 20k` for some value of k. Thus, n must be even
  - Take `5^m - 2^n = 1 (mod 8)` gives us `5^m = 1 (mod 8)`. As per step 2 above, this means m must also be even
  - Since both m and n are even we can write them as 2a and 2b respectively for some natural numbers a and b.
  - We then have `5^(2a) - 2^(2b) = (5^a)^2 - (2^b)^2 = (5^a + 2^b) * (5^a - 2^b)`. For that to equal 1, both terms must be 1, so `5^a + 2^b = 5^a - 2^b = 1 implies 2^b = -2^b = 1` which means `2^b = 0` and thus not 1",

They shouldn't be unless the experiment you're performing somehow knows what happens in the past, or unless you're thinking that maybe the odds weren't equal to begin with.

Doing it without rejection sampling was once a competition/challenge problem. The answer is ""easy"", but ugly.

Roll d6s, subtract 1 from the result and treat the successive throws as a base 6 number starting with 0. Stop rolling when you know your base 6 number is stuck in a 5% interval, and use that interval for the d20.

This works if you replace 6 and 20 with almost anything (except maybe 1)

EDIT (example): Suppose you first dial a 3 which translates to `0.2 (base 6)`, which is `1/3` or `0.333... (base 10)`. No matter what you roll from now on, your result will never be lower than `0.2 (base 6)` and, even if you roll 6's forever, you will never get more than `0.255555.... (base 6)` which is `0.3 (base 6)` or `0.5 (base 10)`.

Thus, after rolling a 3, you are ""trapped"" between the numbers `0.333... (base 10)` and `0.5 (base 10)`. To convert a decimal between 0 and 1 to a d20, you can multiply by 20, add 1, and take the floor of the result, so `0.333... (base 10)` translates to `floor(20*0.333...+1) = floor(7.666...) = 7`, and `0.5 (base 10)` translates to `floor(20*0.5+1) = floor(11) = 11`. Therefore, after rolling a 3 your know your final result will be between 7 and 11. Since that's more than one possibility, you roll again.

Suppose you now roll a 4, so your number so far is `0.23 (base 6)` (remember that you subtract 1 from the 4 so the result is in the range 0-5 not 1-6). That means your final result must be between `0.23 (base 6)` and `0.24 (base 6)` which translates to between `2/6 + 3/36 = 0.41666... (base 10)` and `2/6 + 4/36 = 0.444... (base 10)`. Converting to a d20, that's between `floor(20*0.41666... + 1) = floor(8.333... + 1) = floor(9.333...) = 9` and `floor(20*0.444... + 1) = floor(8.888... + 1)  = floor(9.888...) = 9`.

Since those numbers are the same, you treat this as a 9 on a d20.",

~~In the general case, given n > m, there's a 1/m chance you'll roll a k on the m-sided die (for any value of k between 1 and m), and a (n-k)/n chance the n-sided die will beat it. Therefore, we sum (Mathics format):~~

~~Sum\[(1/m)\*(n-k)/n, {k, 1, m}\]~~

~~which simplifies to (-1 - m + 2 n) / (2 n).~~

~~In your case, n=12 and m=8 yielding 5/8. However, since you want the d8 to beat the d12, it's 1-5/8 or 3/8 or 37.5%~~

~~The chance of tying is:~~

~~Sum\[(1/m)\*(1/n), {k, 1, m}\]~~

~~which is simply 1/n or 1/12 in your case. That adds 8.333...% to give a total chance of \~45.83% of tying or beating, which is close to the 44% you got.~~

The word infinity is used in many different ways in mathematics, and the definition is slightly different in each case. Some examples:

  - The set is infinitely large means you can make a 1-to-1 onto function from the set to a proper subset (eg, map the integers to just the even integers)

  - The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity means the number f(x) gets closer and closer to as x gets larger (which may or may not exist)

  - The limit of f(x) as x approaches k is infinity. The function gets larger than any given number provided that x is close enough to k

So, we can say pi has infinite digits in the ""set is infinite"" sense of infinity, but we can't say pi equals its decimal expansion times infinity (or `10^infinity`) because infinity isn't a number in this case.

Of course, even 2/3 has infinite digits in its base-10 expansion (though they do repeat), so pi isn't really special here: the infinite decimal expansion applies to many other numbers",
