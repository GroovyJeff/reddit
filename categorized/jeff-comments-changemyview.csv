If you're right, and Muslims are flooding into Europe and having 5+ kids to the European's 0 to 1, they're going to be the majority soon and, may, as you say, change the laws to reflect their beliefs. I'm playing Devil's advocate here because even even large Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia don't have sharia law, since you are painting a scenario that suggests European countries may soon observe sharia law.

Once they outnumber the ""native"" Europeans, they won't have to ""properly integrate into society"". It's their society and you'll have to integrate into it. No huge social problems: the society is still cohesive, it's just no longer ""your"" society.

If you really believe what you say, you should speed up the process by suggesting more Muslims move to Europe, encouraging fertility in Muslim families, and converting people to Islam. That will minimize social problems during the transition period.

Abortion is actually a difficult issue and I struggled with it because, as you point out, both the fetus and fetus carrier have rights. You could argue that the fetus carrier owns her womb and the fetus is trespassing, but that contradicts my belief that parents have an obligation to care for their children. I could cheat and say I believe freedom is a BIRTHright, so wouldn't apply to a fetus, but that's cheating.

Ultimately, I believe the fetus has a right to be aborted. Life is hard enough as it is, and being born unwanted just makes it harder. A reasonable person would probably not want to be born with the disadvantage of being unwanted. Therefore, abortion supports the fetus' right not to be born. This raises the ugly question of mandatory abortion, which I will ignore. You could also argue that we expect parents to make the best decisions for their children (except in cases of abuse), so the fetus carries decides, on behalf of the fetus, the best course of action. The counterargument here would be that abortion is abuse, but I would argue euthanasia isn't abuse.

I disagree. You can mine data and present it in a way that makes a certain group seem harmful. As you point out some drivers do think speed limits make roads safer (which is provably wrong in the sense road deaths didn't increase after the highway speed limit was increased from 55), and it's this kind of data mining abuse that makes them think that way. So, yes, choosing which subset of empirical data to present and how to present it can harm groups.

> If you want to make a case that speed limits make the road more dangerous

I'm making the opposite case, but that might've been a typo on your part. However, maybe I should pause to ask: what claim are you making? I thought it was that speed limits increase road safety. Is that not the case? Did I confuse you with someone else on this thread?

> seem like you are just assuming the data will agree with you

Well, raising the highway speed limit didn't increase deaths, and if you accept 50% of highway deaths occur when at least one party is driving over the posted limit, and that 90% of people drive at least a little over the posted limit, you've shown driving at our below the speed limit is 2.5 times as dangerous, which means driving below the speed limit should be illegal. I don't believe in that, but that's where statistical arguments lead us. And, while speed is something we can control, it also leads to pro-racial-profiling arguments

My point is that it doesn't matter if the data agree with me, because you can't punish a specific person for the actions of others. Or, if you absolutely insist on doing so, you must do it consistently by examing all factors, including those that aren't easy to express in English.",

I don't think you actually need P1 because ""sometimes"" doesn't mean it necessarily applies in a specific situation. You either need to say ""always"" or just say ""in this specific case"". Overall, however, I agree your logic is valid.

I believe it is unsound because I disagree with more than one of your premises, not just P4:

  - P1: I agree, but would characterize this as conflict of freedoms: there are cases where two or more parties can claim freedom that conflict with each other and we must resolve which one is an actual freedom and which one is a fictitious freedom. I wouldn't say ""small freedom"" vs ""large freedom"" but just ""actual freedom"" vs ""fictitious freedom"", but same concept.

  - P2: No, there is no absolute right to safe roads, just as there is no absolute right to life. If you jump off a cliff or drive under dangerous conditions (eg, dark, raining, low visibility, etc), no person or government has an obligation to save you.

A right is really just someone else's responsibility. So, one person's right to life is, in general, another person's responsibility not to kill that person. So one person's ""right"" to road safety just means other people's obligation to drive safely.

  - P3: I'd say there's no freedom to drive dangerously, so I'd sort of agree. It's not a small freedom: it's not a freedom at all. I'm opposed to reckless driving, so it's a misrepresentation of my position to say I support driving ""literally any speed you want"". Rather, I'm saying that, if you're driving safely, speed is irrelevant.

  - P4: You are correct in saying I disagree with this point. There is no empirical evidence nor can there be any empirical evidence that driving over the posted limit is riskier than not doing so, since future risk is immeasurable. There is also bias in choosing to looking at a specific element to determine if a given instance of driving is dangerous: by the principle of equality you'd have to look at all possible factors. Further, driving over the posted speed limit sometimes decreases risk, so, in some circumstances, your reasoning would require us to punish those driving at or below the posted limit for increasing risk.

I'll also mention that, in my opinion, rights are not absolutes. You can lose your right to life under some conditions. In particular, I would argue that someone who passes or enforces rights-violating laws such as absolute speed limits loses their rights to pretty much everything, including road safety. This doesn't really affect most people since supporting speed limits is different from passing or enforcing them, but I would argue that, ethically, if a person who supports absolute speed limits is harmed on the road, they do not deserve sympathy.",

> you essentially are an anti-emperialist

Well, more the opposite. I believe in looking at ALL empirical data, not just a small subset designed to harm a specific group of people.

For example, a pure racist might look only at race data for crime (eg, racial profiling) because it's highly unlikely all races commit crime at exactly the same rate. I'm saying asking the question ""which race commits the most crime"" is itself racist because you've pre-determined that you want to harm a specific race (even if you haven't decided which race it is yet).

Similarly, when you ask the question ""what is the relation between speed and road safety"", you've already decided that this relation is more important than other factors that affect road safety presumably because you want to harm people who drive at a certain speed.

If you look at all the data, you'll see there are cases where driving faster is safer, but it's unlikely that you'll punish people for driving at the speed limit because your goal was never to actually draw conclusions from the data, but rather draw the data to support your foregone conclusion.

You also know that if you look at the unobservable empirical data (ie, factual data that you don't measure, either intentionally or otherwise), you'll show that you can make no assessment of risk, because symmetry means the empirical data risk will cancel out.

Effectively, you know you can't compute risk from empirical data, so you cherrypick the data to make it appear the data supports your foregone biased conclusion",

I'm still opposed to reckless driving, so this statement is misleading. I believe in eliminating speed limits, yes, but reckless driving would still be illegal

> You can't say that since raisin it by 10mph didn't increase deaths, totally eliminating it wouldn't either

Actually, inductively, it does. If you accept that raising speed limits 10mph (although it was more than that in some cases, including Montana which briefly eliminated them altogether) doesn't increase deaths, then we could do this repeatedly until speed limits were as high as we wanted. I don't accept this argument, but it does follow from the inductive principle.

> Like making murder illegal or having speed limits

I don't think these are similar enough to make a proper analogy.

Well, OK, have we? I know MESOWEST did a 10-year study on the western USA using randomly selected locations (most of which were in the middle of nowhere) that showed no global warming, but that was a limited time/area study.

If there is a global study of this nature, I've never heard of it (it would be super useful)

Temperatures can change over fairly small distances, but let's say measuring temperature every tenth of a mile would be enough for a gridded approach where we use quantity instead of randomness. Each sensor would therefore cover an area of about 0.0314 square miles. The Earth's surface area is about 197 million square miles, so we would need about 6.2 billion sensors. That's why 20,000 is a meaninglessly small number.

I think my claim is more than measuring global warming using statistics and existing data (which was never collected with the goal of seeing if the Earth is warming) is essentially impossible, so it doesn't matter what approach NASA used.

The same is true of most statistical studies. Once you ask ""if I wanted to study this phenomena, what would I do"", and read the methodology of even a few statistical studies, you'll see they have no hope of being accurate or useful",

A common fallacy in the soft sciences is that a large number of extremely poor studies with no validity somehow makes them valid. Or, ""since we can't perform a good study, let's just assume this bad study's results are accurate"". Science doesn't work that way. No good study = no results.",

Not exactly. I'm saying that if scientists looked at every possible partition, they would realize, correctly, that no conclusion can be drawn from partitioning the data.

Why it's unethical: suppose a scientist found that people fitting a specific criteria Y were historically ten times more likely to do X than people not matching criteria Y and let's even accept that past performance implies future performance (which it doesn't). Now, if a person matching criteria Y and another person not matching criteria Y were to come along, it seems like you could say the Y person is 10x more likely to do X than the non-Y person.

However, suppose the Y person is also a member of the group Z (a variable you chose to ignore when publishing your results) which are known to never do X. Your original conclusion would be invalid because you chose not to look at variable Z. In a more realistic example, this is the basis of racial profiling: considering someone's race (and perhaps age and gender) when determining if they are or may commit a crime while ignoring the zillions of other variables that would show they are LESS likely to commit a crime.

> I don't think that every partition is worth investigating

That's where I disagree. By ignoring certain partitions, you explicitly introduce a bias by deciding ""x can't possibly be responsible for poor health, so we'll ignore it"". Mathematically, there will be tons of partitions that, simply by chance (though you wouldn't know it's by chance) would show a high correlation with or against poor health.

> If any relevant variables are not controlled for, this is what the peer review is for

My claim is that peer review isn't good enough, because non-hostile peers are not motivated to find mistakes in the study. And, as above, unless you decide beforehand which variables aren't relevant, you can't statistically determine them.

Experiments on animals are useful, but we're different from those animals, and, from what I've read, animal experiments often involve megadosing animals with substances, which isn't a realistic representation of how humans consume them.

What would be really useful (though maybe impossible) would be a way of showing the error bound between a given study and a theoretically perfect study. There are cases when you can do this (for example, if you know what you're measuring can only change slowly over time and space), but they are rare. If you could make a convincing argument saying: this study is imperfect, but we can show that, even if we could perform a perfect study, the results would be within 5%. However, this seems impossible.",

They don't believe that field has shown any valid results so far, but they do accept that it's worth studying. So, in that sense, astrology is a valid ""science"".

If you accept hard determinism (and a few other related theorems), no two people have exactly the same horoscope (because planet positions are never 100% the same at two different times or locations, even the variance is in microarcseconds or less), so there is necessarily a 1-to-1 correspondance between a horoscope and a person's life. In that trivial way, astrology is probably true, though not useful.

Cumulative effect. They say the side of the mother a doctor stands on has more gravitational effect on a child than any planet, but what if the doctor's position itself is determined by a planet?

Given enough data, this could reduce the number of potential variables affecting diet to just a few important ones.

I disagree. If you have a sample size of n, there are Bell number of n partitions of that sample. To be stastistically accurate, you'd have to examine every such partition as a variable (many of them will sound complicated in human language, but it's a form of bias to assume that human language identifies relevant variables via shorter names). And, if you do measure every such variable, symmetry will tell you that you can gain no knowledge.

The problem with what you're saying is that people performing these studies will say ""we adjusted for k confounding variables, and can't think of any other reason (except the control variable) that would explain the results"". And k is never anywhere near the Bell number of the sample size. It's also academically dishonest to say ""we can't think of any other reason"", since it's obviously in the researchers interest to not find confounding variables they haven't accounted for. At the very least, the study should be reviewed by a hostile panel that would propose additional confounding variables.

Therefore I maintain that, once you throw out random sampling and control, your study isn't valid and can't show causation. Scientists just need to bite the bullet and say ""we don't know and we have no ethical way of finding out""",

There are so many other reasons some people die earlier than others and you're not controlling for those

  - the 19,899 participants were volunteers and not randomly selected. This is another basic problem with most human-based social studies: the participants aren't a random sample and the results are therefore statistically invalid. The fact that the male-female ratio is so far off is evidence of the larger problem (the representation of various groups is different in the study than in real life): you can compensate for some of the differences (like gender), but not all of them

  - Of the 19,899 participants, only 335 or 1.7% died. That's a very small percentage. The results for 1.7% of the population are worthless compared to the other 98.3%.

The problem: when people make statements like the above, others assume they're saying cigarettes are safe. Not at all.

No, it's because some differences are more visible (such as skin color or height or weight or even age to some extent), not because they're more important or predictive/descriptive

Generalizations are a logical fallacy. Our human brains make lots of those, but that just invalidates our belief in our own intelligence. Our belief in something doesn't make it true, but showing something is false ""should"" make us disbelief it. Truth should guide our thinking, not vice versa.",
