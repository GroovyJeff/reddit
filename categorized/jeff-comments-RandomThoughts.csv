These two contradict each other. Most people will never have a wide enough variety of experience to make valid generalizations. You can't ""learn from experience"" unless you mean looking at the experiences of millions of people, and even that has statistical issues

> what purpose does stupidity serve?

Nowadays, people won't accept ""all X are bad because I once met a bad X"" because even the common (stupid) man is smart enough to know generalizations are false and discriminatory.

So you have to appeal to psuedoscience, since that's a form of stupidity many people still accept.

> A stupid person is one who causes harm to another person or group without at the same time obtaining a benefit for himself or even damaging himself

Maybe, but only because it's really hard to change people's minds. I'd argue that many stupid people are TRYING to obtain a benefit for themselves in the sense of changing people's opinions, but they usually don't succeed.

The problem: Einstein was questioning the quantum mechanics assumption that you can perform the ""same"" experiment twice and get different results. In other words, Einstein was claiming determinism. However, pretty much every quantum mechanical experiment performed verifies that Einstein was wrong. To be fair, Einstein accepted quantum mechanics as a valid description of what happens when you perform certain experiments, but never accepted it psychologically (""God does not play dice with the universe"")",
