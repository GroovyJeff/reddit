Realistically, most of my code has no impact on the world, but I still enjoy writing it. I personally believe people create blogs so they can write stuff, not because anyone will read it. I treat OS coding the same way

  - I don't have to pay for most high-quality software. I can use professional tools that I otherwise couldn't afford for free

  - It forces commercial software vendors to have higher standards. If people can get a tool for free, you really have to add value to charge for it. The baseline is no longer ""a tool that does a thing"" but ""a tool that does a thing better than existing free tools""",
