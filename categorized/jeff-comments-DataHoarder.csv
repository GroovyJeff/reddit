I'm proud to share:

  - GAIA data for about 3 billion stars, about 752G

  - elevation data at 1/9th second resolution for parts of the USA (example: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d0aeaf1e4b0e3d311602697), also elevation data from SRTM1 and other sources, about 867GB total

  - about 529GB of networking data from RIPE (registrar), including daily reverse DNS zones, but I no longer remember what I wanted it for

  - 30 second song samples from spotify, about 511GB

  - Genome/genetic data from NIH, about 369GB

  - mutliple full copies of openstreetmap.org data, about 229GB

  - Climate and weather data, including hourly ISD worldwide and per-minute ASOS for specific US locations; also GHCND and worldclim.org data, 214GB total

  - VSOP data to compute planetary and satellite positions long term including the NOMAD1 star dataset, about 207G

  - National Register Information System data of historic sites, about 165GB

  - population data from worldpop.org and GPW, about 155GB

  - prime numbers, about 52GB

  - Other data that's not super big but that I'm interested in personally: Koeppen-Geiger climate, ESACCI landcover and landuse, solar energy availability, ethnicity data, administrative data (gadm.org), and animal habitat data (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)

and other stuff not listed here. The sizes above are how much they're using on my disk, but I may have multiple copies or derived files, so the amounts above may not be 100% accurate",
