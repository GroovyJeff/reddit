I mean we still have folks who believe climate change is just a temporary weather phase

Statements like this are the real problem, in my opinion. I believe the Earth is round(ish), but I don't believe in global warming. By equating the two, you're implying they are equally valid.

If we're going to sell science to the masses, we have to admit it can be wrong, has been wrong, and probably will be wrong in the future. At best, it gives us an explanation that is consistent with observations and hopefully has some predictive value.

For things like evolution, we have to make it clear that the general concept of descent with modification (which is a way better term than ""evolution"") is scientifically strong, but times and dates may not be. That way, when someone shows a given paleontological find is false or fraudulent, people understand that doesn't ""disprove evolution"".

> Our culture is becoming a place where everyone claims to be an expert on everything, except actual experts [...] Rational thinking is crucial for making informed decisions and solving problems effectively

These statements sort of contradict each other. As a rational thinker, I want experts to be able to explain WHY they believe in something, and not just say ""I'm an expert so I'm right"" or even ""this is what I was taught in school, with no explanation of why, so it's right"".

> Science illiteracy is hindering our ability to solve big issues like pandemics or space travel or war or corruption or a class discrepancy or racism or nuclear arms or the economy orâ€¦.

Although you give several examples in your post, could you give some examples specific to space travel, war, corruption, class discrepancy, racism, and nuclear arms. It's not clear to me that scientific literacy can solve these issues. At some point, things like ethics and fundamental belief systems come into play.",

If you really want to engage (and you probably don't), let me start with:

  - Define global warming in a way that can be tested

  - Design an experiment to test if global warming is occurring

  - Show that we've performed an experiment that is similar enough that we have evidence of global warming",

Because determining temperature from ice core samples has a high degree of inaccuracy, enough to invalidate the concept temperatures have increase

>  Why don't you think we have a way of measuring average surface temperature over the last century? 

Well, we don't. The only observations I've seen aren't randomly sampled and are subject to poor siting and increasing heat from airports and city

>  Uhhh, observations are a valid form of measurement... 

Yes, but estimates based on observations are less accurate.

The problem: if you want to show the Earth's temperature is increasing, why not do so directly? The two attempts I know of to do this both failed to show statistically signifigant warming.

Also, the NASA page doesn't talk about the Earth's albedo increasing, which would imply global cooling. Pages that like are biased and thus unreliable.",

>  Source? Why are ice core samples inaccurate?

Find a source showing how temperatures are determined from ice cores and it should explain the accuracy limitations

>  Source? Why don't you think these average surface temperatures are accurate? You'd expect temperature readings from 100 years ago aren't randomly sampled....  

Correct. And if they aren't randomly sampled, they can't be representative. How else would you accurately measure the world's surface temperature (which is also the question I asked earlier)?

> What type of measurements would you rather see? 

Actual measurements of data, not estimates based on observations. For example, if ice cover decreases 10% but you estimate their depth has decreased by 10% as well, you'll get a lower number than if you estimated the depth remained the same.

>  Why don't you think these things have been done directly?  

Well, show me where? I don't recall the two experiments (one was Mesowest and the other is that graph that allegedly shows 0.2 degree increase but doesn't really), but I'll flip it: show me a source where accurate measurements DO show an increase. Even the two I remember only covered the mountain states (Mesowest) and the United States (the other one).

>  But the Earth's albedo isnt increasing.... It's actually decreasing as sea ice melts.

Source? I could've sworn I saw an article about it increasing

>  False. Bias doesn't mean unreliable. Also, how is the page biased? 

The page is biased because it provides evidence of global warming, but not of global cooling. Presenting only evidence for one side is bias.",

I also shouldn't have tried to countersource because that shifts the burden to me.

OK, here's how I understand the global warming claim: if we could measure the Earth's average air temperature about 2 meters above ground level over the last 150 or so years, we would see a staistically signifigant increase.

However, we have no good data to determine whether the Earth's temperature has increased, decreased, or remained about the same.

So that's what I'm asking for: good evidence that the Earth's average temperature (as defined above or by any reasonable metric) is actually increasing above and beyond random fluctuations.

As far as I know, every attempt to make an accurate measurement of the Earth's temperature change has shown essentially zero change. However, if you have a good source that says otherwise, I want to see it.",
