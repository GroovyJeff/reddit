If you're in this situation, just sleep instead of scrolling. Sleeping will give you more energy for later, whereas scrolling is just a waste of time. Keep in mind this advice is coming from someone who is currently doomscrolling Reddit.

The other option is stimulants. You'll build up tolerance, so start with something like caffeine and work your way up to crystal meth",

This is unhelpful, but the programmer's rule to time estimates: take your original number, double it, add one, and move to the next higher unit. So 5 minutes becomes 5 times 2 plus is 11 and minutes becomes hours so 11 hours. If you're doing 5 minutes worth of work in 15 minutes, you're WAY ahead of most coders :)",
