Historically, there have been many paradoxes in mathematics: Zeno ""proved"" motion was impossible, Russell created a set that was both inside and outside another set, and so on.

Mathematicians eventually decided to formalize set theory to avoid these paradoxes, but there's no guarantee they have. There might be another paradox lurking that could, in theory, invalidate existing proofs.

Godels Incompleteness Theorem tells us no deductive system that contains multiplication can be both complete and consistent. That means either our current set of axioms (and axiom schema) can't assign a true or false value to every proposition (this part is known to be true) or will eventually show true = false, rendering proofs meaningless until we resolve the issue, or both.",

If we remove the fifth row, we have 6 appearing 6 times out of 30, or 1/5th.

The problem: we also have to throw out 15, 25, 35, and 45 because a 5 comes before a 6. This means we now have 26 possibilities left and 6 is the first roll in 6 of them.

The other answer is gave was a maritime boundary between Guadalupe and Montserrat, but this answer is wrong: the two islands are close, but don't share a maritime border:

Not exactly. On a PDF, the number of samples at a given exact value is always 0, because you're looking at a single real number, and there's 0% chance that a sample has a specific real value (0% in the sense of probability distributions, without getting to philosophical).

Instead, you can use the PDF to determine how many samples occur between two values by integrating the PDF. For example, if you wanted to know the percentage of people between 40 and 50 at the time the sample was taken, you'd integrate the PDF from 40 to 50. Note that the result is a percentage (between 0 and 1), not the number of people between 40 and 50.

So, since we're not counting samples, how can a PDF go above 1? Easy: consider the PDF that's equal to 1 million between 0 and 10^-6, and 0 elsewhere. No matter what portion of this function you integrate, you'll always gets a number between 0 and 1, even though the PDF has a very high max value.

In general, the PDF's ""amplitude"" is chosen so that the PDF integrates out to 1, which it must. However, this doesn't mean that portions of the PDF can have values higher than 1",

You could take the derivative and set equal to 0, but, since we're only looking for the minimum distance, we notice that this distance is minimal when its square is minimal, so we take derivative of `x^2 + p(x)^2` and set equal to 0 instead. 

The derivative is `2x + 2p(x)*p'(x)`. If `p(x)` has degree n, `p(x)*p'(x)` has degree `n + (n-1) = 2n-1`, so you have to solve a `2n-1` degree polynomial",

This is just one example of why you can't apply group statistics to individuals.

Well, it would be:

`f(p) = Binomial[1000,600]*p^600*(1-p)^400`

where `Binomial` is the binomial coefficient.

Note that this gives you the relative likelihood that p is the correct probability, not the absolute likelihood that p is the correct likelihood (I'm using the word 'likelihood' interchangeably with 'probability' to try to make things easier to read)

For example, `f[0.60] = 0.0257448` and `f[0.55] = 0.000157966`, so it's `f[0.60]/f[0.55] ~ 163` times more likely that the actual probability is 0.6 than that the actual probability is 0.55

If we integrate f(p) between 0 and 1, we get 1/1001 instead of 1. That's not surprising since we're only measuring relative likelihood, not absolute. To turn this into a probability distribution, we multiply by 1001 to get:

`g(p) = 1001*Binomial[1000,600]*p^600*(1-p)^400`

as your probability distribution function.

We can now integrate g(p) between 0.55 and 0.65 to find the likelihood that the actual probability is between those two values is about 0.998783

I also integrated g(p) from 0.569 to 0.6305 per https://new.reddit.com/user/FormulaDriven/ suggestion and got 95.322%, roughly in the same range",

As an example, what are the chances you'll get just 1s, 3s, and 5s in the first 10 rolls followed by an even number?

Note there are `6^10` total ways to roll a die 10 times

There are `3^10` ways to roll a die 10 times with only odd numbers.

However, the count above includes cases where you only roll 1s and 3s, and don't roll any 5s, for example.

The ways you can roll only 1s and 3s is `2^10`. The ways you can roll only 1s and 5s is `2^10`, and the ways you can only roll 3s and 5s is `2^10`. We have to subtract these off so our running total is now `3^10 - 3*2^10`

When we removed ""only 1s and 5s"" and ""only 1s and 3s"", we removed ""only 1s"" twice, so we need to add it back in (just 1 way to get all 1s). Similarly for ""only 3s"" and ""only 5s"".

That brings our final total to `3^10 - 3*2^10 + 3 = 55980`. So there are `55980/6^10 = 1555/1679616` to roll all three odd numbers in 10 rolls, and we multiply that by 1/2 to make the 11th roll even to get a final answer (for 10 rolls) of `1555/3359232`

For n rolls followed by an even, we have `3^n` for only odd rolls, minus `3*2^n` for only odd rolls that only have two numbers plus 3 for single number odd rolls, or `3^n - 3*2^n + 3` total. The chances are therefore `(3^n - 3*2^n + 3)/6^n/2`, the final `/2` being for the even roll following

I cheated and used WolframAlpha (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Sum%5B%283%5En+-+3*2%5En+%2B+3%29%2F6%5En%2F2%2C+%7Bn%2C3%2C+Infinity%7D%5D) and this sum turns out to be 1/20.

Therefore, there is 1/20 chance of getting all 3 odd numbers before seeing an even number",

You could try something like:

If `n` is odd, then `3n+1` is `odd*odd + odd = odd + odd = even`, so the next number will be `(3n+1)/2`. Now, despite the `/2`, there's no way to know if `(3n+1)/2` is odd or even, since it may have other powers of 2. You can then choose the number `k` that makes `(3n+1)/2^k` odd.

You can then repeat the `3n+1` step to get `1 + (3 + 9n)/2^k` (after simplification). The numerator is `odd + odd*odd` -> `odd + odd` -> `even`. However, we don't know how many powers of 2 appear in `3 + 9n`. We know it must be AT LEAST k since the result is a natural number, but it could be more.

Therefore, we don't know if `(3+9n)/2^k` is even or odd, and thus don't know if `1+ (3+9n)/2^k` is even or odd. We can divide out all powers of two by dividing by 2^j where j could be 0 if the number if already odd.

This gives us `(1 + (3+9n)/2^k)/2^j`. Since this is odd, we apply `3n+1` again to get `1 + 3/2^j + 9*2^(-j - k) + 27*2^(-j - k)*n`.

If you continue on this way, you'll find it's quite a waste of time",

In your case, `{1,0}` is in the relation and `{0,1}` is in the relation, so transitivity would require `{1,1}` to be in the relation, which it isn't, so the relation isn't transitive.

So you're right, but for the wrong reason :)",

Hypothesis: if  a randomly selected overweight or obese person tries to lose weight, they will get healthier. Specifics:

  - We measure health on a numerical scale by self-assesement of health and happiness over the past 2 weeks (or any period we agree on)

  - We measure health when they start trying to lose weight and again 6 months (or any period we agree on) later

  - Claim: the number of people whose health rating has increased will be higher than the number of people whose health rating has decreased by a statistically significant amount.

Caveats:

  - We assume, incorrectly, that past performance implies future performance. Changes in medicine (perhaps in particular the advent of Ozempic) could change results.

  - We only look at people who are obese or overweight and are trying to lose weight. We do NOT look at:

- people who are obese or overweight and lose weight incidentally without trying

- people who are not obese or overweight but are trying to lose weight (eg, anorexics and bulimics but also others)

  - We do not cherrypick: the hypothesis applies to all overweight or obese people trying to lose weight. After obtaining results, we will not try to claim the result applies to a subset of the population we've selected.

Do you agree that this is our hypothesis?",

ChatGPT also got 210, but then I asked ""But since the groups of two are identical, wouldn't the answer be half that?"" and it answered:

You're absolutely correct. Since the groups of two are identical, each combination is counted twice in the calculation. Thus, we need to divide the total number of combinations by 2 to correct for this overcounting.

So, the correct number of ways is:

[210/2 = 105]

You could try asking fast food places that, but the person answering the phone probably won't know or won't tell you. Additionally, the exact amount will vary even in the same fast food place because not all small fries are filled identically.

The most tedious way to do this would be to purchase small fries several times on different days at each restaurant, record the price, weigh the fries (remembering to subtract off the tare weight: the weight of the container), compute mean and standard deviation, and proceed from there.

If you can find a proof that it holds for all even numbers between `10^20` and `10^21`, for example, you'd at least have something, though still not a complete proof.

Note that `2*10^500 + 2150 = (10^500 + 961) + (10^500 + 1189)` shows the Goldbach Conjecture for a 501-digit number, but that's not really impressive because it only took me a few seconds to come up with.",

If anything, people seem to stop thinking and get set in their ways by the time they turn 25. Therefore, it's important to have as many experiences as possible (including love, sex, romance, heartache, etc) BEFORE turning 25.

Your view that ""giggling at texts from so-and-so"" and that sex and romance are ""frivolous activities"" are also personal opinions that not everyone shared.

I realize these are only my opinions, and that not everyone who supports Trump is a libertarian. Others might believe that what Trump did happens all the time and that Trump was targeted for selective enforcement to harm his campaign. Still others may believe that, despite the jury selection process, it's difficult or impossible to get a fair jury in such a heavily Democrat controlled county. There are even a few people who would argue that, if he makes a good President, his personal life is irrelevant. And, of course, there's the appeals process.

The events are independent, so the chance you'll be wrong 365 days is `(364/365)^365 ~ 0.367` (nearly 1/E), so the chance you'll be right at least once is `1 - (364/365)^365 ~ 0.633` or 63.3%

If you draw without replacement and never get it right, your series of draws is a ""derangement"" of 365 elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement), and is given by OEIS sequence 000166: https://oeis.org/A000166 -- It turns out it's surprisingly hard to get a value for this (OEIS doesn't go that far), but it turns out to be about `9.325*10^777`. The total number of orderings is `365! ~ 2.51*10^778`, so the chance of being wrong every day is `9.325*10^777/2.51*10^778 = 0.371514` (approximately 1/E) so your chance of at least one success is `1 - 0.371514 ~ 0.628486` or about 62.8%

As the number 365 grows larger, the two probabilities grow closer together.

I've probably done a lot of unnecessary math above, and am hoping someone can provide a much clearer intuitive explanation of why these probabilities are essentially equal.

If you were to randomly select a day of the week (7 options), your chance with replacement would be ~60.7% and without replacement would be ~63.2%, which surprises me since I thought with replacement would yield a higher chance",

The laws I oppose: paying someone to keep legally obtained information private is not illegal; campaign contributions should not be limited

Leaving that aside, I believe Donald Trump had the right to pay Stormy Daniels hush money.

I believe that smoking (cigarettes or marijuna) is dangerous except to people who are non-COPD suspectible, but I'm saying you can't mathematically show that ""someone who never smokes is less likely to develop lung cancer than someone who does smoke"".

What you might be able to say if statistics bear it out: if we count all the people who are currently living and who have ever died (maybe put some sort of limit on it), group them into smokers and nonsmokers (not trivial, since smoking 1 cigarette 1 time doesn't make you a smoker), we will see a greater percentage of smokers have lung cancer than nonsmokers.

Of course, because correlation isn't causation, this doesn't mean smoking causes lung cancer, but it doesn't mean the opposite either.

Additionally, by drawing an arbitrary line between ""smoker"" and ""nonsmoker"", we ignore how much someone smokes, what they smoke, when in life they smoke, their overall general health, and so on. If we attempt to determine someone's chance of developing lung cancer from these data, we are assuming all smokers have the same chance of developing lung cancer, which can't possibly be true.

My argument is more ""don't abuse mathematics"" than ""smoking is safe""",

I mean we still have folks who believe climate change is just a temporary weather phase

Statements like this are the real problem, in my opinion. I believe the Earth is round(ish), but I don't believe in global warming. By equating the two, you're implying they are equally valid.

If we're going to sell science to the masses, we have to admit it can be wrong, has been wrong, and probably will be wrong in the future. At best, it gives us an explanation that is consistent with observations and hopefully has some predictive value.

For things like evolution, we have to make it clear that the general concept of descent with modification (which is a way better term than ""evolution"") is scientifically strong, but times and dates may not be. That way, when someone shows a given paleontological find is false or fraudulent, people understand that doesn't ""disprove evolution"".

> Our culture is becoming a place where everyone claims to be an expert on everything, except actual experts [...] Rational thinking is crucial for making informed decisions and solving problems effectively

These statements sort of contradict each other. As a rational thinker, I want experts to be able to explain WHY they believe in something, and not just say ""I'm an expert so I'm right"" or even ""this is what I was taught in school, with no explanation of why, so it's right"".

> Science illiteracy is hindering our ability to solve big issues like pandemics or space travel or war or corruption or a class discrepancy or racism or nuclear arms or the economy or….

Although you give several examples in your post, could you give some examples specific to space travel, war, corruption, class discrepancy, racism, and nuclear arms. It's not clear to me that scientific literacy can solve these issues. At some point, things like ethics and fundamental belief systems come into play.",

You can go to worldpop.org to get the nld_ppp_2020_UNadj_constrained.tif file mentioned in the code.

Roughly speaking, the code converts all the populated (non-0, non-NA) points in the TIF to the unit sphere in 3D, creates a KDTree of them, queries a given point with a given radius, and adds the population of all points found.

Since I'm using the unit sphere and 3D, you have to convert stuff before querying. Obviously, a more polished version would use functions to do this. The code:

```

width = ArchGDAL.width(dataset)

# find only points with Dutch people

# NOTE: there are 1512630 such points out of height*width = 15849120
# total points, so big savings here (nearly 90% decrease)

dutchpts = findall(i -> i>0, array)

# note these are parallel arrays; they are NOT Cartesian producted together

lngs = [gt[1] + (i[1]-0.5)*gt[2] for i in dutchpts]
lats = [gt[4] + (i[2]-0.5)*gt[6] for i in dutchpts]

xs = cosd.(lats) .* cosd.(lngs)
ys = cosd.(lats) .* sind.(lngs)
zs = sind.(lats)

# uncomment this line to see what the points look like 

# scatter3d(xs, ys, zs, markersize = 0.1)

treepts = transpose(hcat(xs, ys, zs))

tree = KDTree(treepts)

# sample query point (Amsterdam)

queryLat = 52.366668723027
queryLng = 4.88333731194361

Why not just sell the goods at market value? Because the IRS allows depreciation to be calculated in a way that taxes on the loss value are reduced by more than the fair market price. In other words, if a company could sell items at $100, it might be able to depreciate them for $700 and save $200 in taxes, coming out ahead.",

Yes, but estimates based on observations are less accurate.

The problem: if you want to show the Earth's temperature is increasing, why not do so directly? The two attempts I know of to do this both failed to show statistically signifigant warming.

Also, the NASA page doesn't talk about the Earth's albedo increasing, which would imply global cooling. Pages that like are biased and thus unreliable.",

>  Source? Why are ice core samples inaccurate?

Find a source showing how temperatures are determined from ice cores and it should explain the accuracy limitations

>  Source? Why don't you think these average surface temperatures are accurate? You'd expect temperature readings from 100 years ago aren't randomly sampled....  

Correct. And if they aren't randomly sampled, they can't be representative. How else would you accurately measure the world's surface temperature (which is also the question I asked earlier)?

> What type of measurements would you rather see? 

Actual measurements of data, not estimates based on observations. For example, if ice cover decreases 10% but you estimate their depth has decreased by 10% as well, you'll get a lower number than if you estimated the depth remained the same.

>  Why don't you think these things have been done directly?  

Well, show me where? I don't recall the two experiments (one was Mesowest and the other is that graph that allegedly shows 0.2 degree increase but doesn't really), but I'll flip it: show me a source where accurate measurements DO show an increase. Even the two I remember only covered the mountain states (Mesowest) and the United States (the other one).

>  But the Earth's albedo isnt increasing.... It's actually decreasing as sea ice melts.

Source? I could've sworn I saw an article about it increasing

>  False. Bias doesn't mean unreliable. Also, how is the page biased? 

The page is biased because it provides evidence of global warming, but not of global cooling. Presenting only evidence for one side is bias.",

The fact you realize you don't have hours to masturbate probably means you're not addicted. You understand you have other priorities and haven't let masturbation take over your life.

OK, here's how I understand the global warming claim: if we could measure the Earth's average air temperature about 2 meters above ground level over the last 150 or so years, we would see a staistically signifigant increase.

However, we have no good data to determine whether the Earth's temperature has increased, decreased, or remained about the same.

So that's what I'm asking for: good evidence that the Earth's average temperature (as defined above or by any reasonable metric) is actually increasing above and beyond random fluctuations.

As far as I know, every attempt to make an accurate measurement of the Earth's temperature change has shown essentially zero change. However, if you have a good source that says otherwise, I want to see it.",

Another way to think about it: there is a `102/342160` chance that any given ticket will win, so you estimate the chance that one of 602 will win as 602 times that number or `102/342160*602 = 2193/12220 ~ 17.95%`.

If there's no way to verify wether A occurred or not other than the occurrence of T, if T is not present wouldn't that mean there is a 20% probability that A did not occur?

Answering this simpler question:

  - If A did not occur, there is an 100% chance T would not be there

  - If A did occur, there's an 80% chance T would not be there.

So, if T is not there, it's 100/80 as likely A did not occur, and that ratio translates to `100/(100+80) ~ 55.56%`. However, I believe this assumes A is 50% likely to happen. If we know A occurs frequently or infrequently, this would change.",

So, if none of them are there it's about three times more likely (100%) that A didn't occur than the 33.6% that it did. So you need two proabilities that add to 1 (of course) in the ratio 100:33.6.

If the probabilities were equal, you'd have a trivial argument showing the chances are 50%

Since the probabilities aren't equal, you'd have to pair a given string where 'b' wins with a given string where 'a' wins (perhaps the string with the a's and b's flipped) and compute how more likely the 'b wins' string is to the 'a wins' string.

Otherwise `A` would've already won earlier.

`A` can win in any of the following ways (where `Binomial[n,k]` is the binomial coefficient):

  - win 10 games straight, `p = (1/3)^10`

  - win 9 of the first 10 games and then win the 11th game, `p = Binomial[10,9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)*(1/3)`

  - win 9 of 11 games and then win the 12th game, `p = Binomial[11,9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)^2*(1/3)`

  - general case: win 9 of the first 10+n-1 games and then win the (10+n)th game: `p = Binomial[10+n-1, 9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)^n*(1/3)`

The n above starts at n = 0, winning 9 of the first 9 games and then also winning the 10th game (same as 10 in a row) and goes to n = 9, win 9 of the first 18 games and then win the 19th game. Note that if n = 10, winning the first 9 of 19 games would mean losing 10 of those 19 games, so `B` would win.

The answer is thus:

`Sum[Binomial[10+n-1, 9]*(1/3)^9*(2/3)^n*(1/3), {n, 0, 9}]`

which is 75275227/1162261467 or about 6.477%

As /u/lilganj710 notes, this is the CDF of the negative binomial distribution with parameters 10 and 1/3 evaluated at 9",

Not a pure math requirement. It might be possible to show such operations exist without enumerating them.

> Given x. If it is possible to represent x as a sum of fibonacci numbers, print on the first line k, the number of fibonacci numbers in your expression. On the next line, print the numbers themselves. If it is impossible, print -1

Again, finding such numbers for a specific integer is different from proving the general case. Consider the `10^(10^100)`th Fibbonacci number. The math proof would work for this, but I don't think any coding challenge could solve that.

This sounds like confirmation bias: you want to see polyamorous people as unhappy so you do. It's also possible you've met too few polyamorous people and are judging all of them based on a small number.

You sound angry at polyamorists because you think they're ""stealing"" available partners from you and shrinking the dating pool for monogamous relationships. They're not.

If I understand your question correctly, you're saying the stock you buy MUST reach a higher price SOMETIME, and you can sell it then.

Even ignoring things like commissions and risk-free interest, if you keep following this strategy, you will eventually end up buying a stock at its highest price. Or, the price will be higher over 100 years from now or the stock will go bankrupt and become worthless. So your strategy may fail or be impractical

Since you have 2 variables and 5 equations, you normally wouldn't expect to get a perfect fit, so you'd tweak `m` and `p` until your total error squared (the difference between the formula's prediction for energy consumption and actual energy consumption, quantity squared) is minimal. /u/QCD-uctdsb provides you with the technical steps.

That's not really a lot. It's less than 1/5th. For a truly universal language, we'd want it ideally at 100%, but at least at 90%

> around 1.1 Billion of the world's population learned english as their 2nd language and only around 200million for mandarin

That's not really relevant. It doesn't matter if someone knows a language natively or non-natively. If 95% of the world spoke the same language natively, that would become the de facto world language. Additionally, people have a stake in making their native language the universal one since it means they don't have to learn a second language.

> Aint no way that much people is learning english if its not the universal language

That just means a lot of people are convinced English is a good 2nd language to have, or even that a lot of people are convinced English is or will be the universal language. However, that doesn't mean it actually is

> So you tellin me if we were to create a universal language, it shouldnt be the most spoken???

That's another logical fallacy. I said ""if X is the world's most spoken language, then X is not necessarily the universal language"". You're accusing me of saying the opposite (converse): ""If X it the universal language, then it is not necessarily the most spoken"".",

The ASCII table (https://www.lookuptables.com/text/ascii-table) encodes upper and lower letters, numbers, symbols, and a few ""control codes"" (the first 32 entries). It uses up 128 entries total, or 7 bits. If you use only these bytes, you are in ""ASCII mode"". If you use any characters outside of these, you are in ""binary mode"".

Even today, some languages, some programs and some operating systems distinguish between the two modes. Example: https://diveintopython.org/learn/file-handling/binary-files

In particular, some SMTP servers don't handle binary data well, so you have to encode (not encrypt) your message into ASCII. Base64 (aka MIME-64) is actually a pretty efficient system, using 8 bits to store 6 bits of data. I'm old enough to remember uuencode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding), which was less efficient.

Assume the red balloons have odd numbers, 1 and 3, and the yellow balloons have even numbers, 2 and 4. Now, looking that `4!` equally likely distributions (where the first two balloons go to kid 1, the second pair go to kid 2), we have:

`{{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 4, 3}, {1, 3, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4, 2}, {1, 4, 2, 3}, {1, 4, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3, 4}, {2, 1, 4, 3}, {2, 3, 1, 4}, {2, 3, 4, 1}, {2, 4, 1, 3}, {2, 4, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2, 4}, {3, 1, 4, 2}, {3, 2, 1, 4}, {3, 2, 4, 1}, {3, 4, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 2, 1}, {4, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 1, 3, 2}, {4, 2, 1, 3}, {4, 2, 3, 1}, {4, 3, 1, 2}, {4, 3, 2, 1}}`

Well, you first notice the number is even so its divisible by 2. It's still even so you can divide it by 2 again and it turns out a third time.

This leaves us with 9428895 and we notice the sum of the digits, 45, is divisible by 9, so the number itself is divisible by 9. Since 9 is 3^2 we note 3 is a prime factor, and we are left with 1047655

The result ends in 5 so you know its divisible by 5, so go ahead and divide it by 5. Note down that 5 is one of the prime factors in case it turns out to be the biggest (it's not, but we don't know that yet)

Now, you're left with 209531. Since you've factored out all 2's, 3's, and 5's, you might want to look at 7 next. I don't know a shortcut for 7, but dividing it gives us 29933, a whole number, so it works.

There IS a trick for 11, add the even numbered digits, add the odd numbered digits and subtract. If the result is 0, the number is divisible by 11. For 29933, we have 14-12=2 so its not divisble by 11.

Unfortunately, I don't know how you'd easily realize that 29933 is divisible by 37, leaving a result of 809, which is prime.",

Of course, you may end up with combinations of these factors that no one has previously had (or too few people have had to make valid estimation), but let's ignore that for now.

Suppose I introduct a new metric: the sum of the number of letters in the first two states someone lived in (0 if a state is null). ""There's no way that metric has anything to do with life expectancy"" you might say. And you'd probably be right. However, if we keep looking, we might (in fact, must) find a metric that's better at predicting life expectancy than any of the ones you're using and any combinations of those.

Now, you have a problem: why are you deliberately ignoring an accurate correlation and choosing age, etc? That's because you believe, in a non-mathematically-provable sense, that those factors are more important.

I claim this is a defect in the English language, statistics in general, and the cause of most discrimination. I'm also worried that, when AI starts pumping out discriminatory statement, people will believe them because they think AI is unbiased.

To be mathematically accurate, you have to consider all possible partitions of your population into 1 or more subsets. You could make the weak argument that there's no way to do that, so you have to use only the data that's available (definition of availibility bias)

However, you can via symmetry. The number of partitions of n people is the Bell number of n. If you consier all of these partitions, by symmetry, everyone will have the same life expectancy.",

Zeno rationally showed that motion is impossible (at least, that's one variant of the paradox) and posted that on the Internet (ie, he told other philosophers about it).

Zeno wasn't an idiot: he knew motion was possible. He was showing that, though pure reasoning (that was accepted at the time) you could come up with ridiculous conclusions. He was ""mocking"" ""pure math"" by showing it's contradicts real life.

Russell and others have done the same. It's taken us a long time to find an axiom system that appears to be contradiction-free. However, Godel has shown that we can't rule out the possibility a contradiction exists.

If Terence Howard can create an argument that makes rational (or even physical) sense, then he might be showing our current axiom system is flawed.

Realistically, however, I don't think Howard used axiomatic proof methods, so his error lies elsewhere. His claim isn't ""1*1 = 2"" is common sense. Rather, his claim is that ""using common sense, I can show 1*1 = 2; therefore something is wrong with math"".",

You can, of course, put n points on the equator (or any line of longitude or any other great circle) equidistantly, but I'm assuming no 3 points can be colinear? This corresponds to the ""orange slice"" model of splitting the sphere. Interesting, but not extensible to smaller slices",

Reading the rest of the article and assuming Sloot actually had something, I think Sloot's system was something similar to ""hashing"", the same thing bittorrent uses. Hash collisions (two different files having the same hash) does occur, but is rare, even in shorter hashes such as sha512 (64 bytes). With a well-chosen 8000-byte hash, and even allowing for the birthday paradox, you could easily assign a ""probably unique"" number to each file.

I will check the code you've written as well, but Sloot seems to be saying ""if two computers have the same file, you only need to transfer a small amount of information to retrieve the file on the 2nd computer"". Since we can now search millions of computers for that one file (bittorrent), this almost makes sense: if a file has been created and someone has it and is willing to share it, you can almost certainly find it just by its hash",

Do you have a source for this? I'm not saying it's not true, but the Pew research report I vaguely remember reading suggests otherwise, especially for Muslims who live outside countries that observe sharia law.

Even if you could show the majority harbor extremist views, it would be wrong to judge an individual person solely by their religion. You have to consider all factors about that and not assume they are identical or even similar to other people who share (or claim to share) their religion.

> He was a respectable man, so I don't disagree with him.

This is really problematic because, while we love and respect our grandparents and ancestors, they often have views that were acceptable at the time (Blacks should drink from different water fountains and attend different schools), but no longer are. You can respect people and still realize they're not perfect and that it's difficult for someone to hold progressive views in a non-progressive time.",

The argument that children who were hit are more violent could be reverse correlation: the children who were fundamentally (and perhaps biologically) more violent were disciplined physically more. If they hadn't been, they'd be even more violent that they are now.

This is absolutely correct. Violence is the final answer. If you teach kids otherwise, you're lying to them. Of course, it's OK to lie to kids sometime, but not about this (in my opinion).",

I still believe that physical punishments MAY be valid, and that children should learn this early on. Ultimately, we fight wars with weapons, not hugs. We approach violent criminals with guns, not therapy.

So I guess the answer to the OP's question would be ""because they thought it would help their children become better people [the Bible explicitly states 'spare the rod, spoil the child' and many Americans are Christian], but, depending on how you define 'better people', this may've worked for some children and not for others. Overall, both crime and corporal punishment have decreased over the years, so, if you define 'better people' as 'committing fewer crimes', the theory has failed at that higher level"".

""HOWEVER, some parents would argue that people becoming less religious, protesting the government more, and using recreational substances more, while not always illegal, make them 'bad people', so, in their eyes, and assuming they believe corporally-punished children engage less in these activities, they were correct""",

OK, can you source this? More specifically, what claims they made, and what the results were?

This is not a factual statement because of the ""only"". There are many good reasons to reduce regulations including inherent basic freedom.

But we've had plenty of Democrat presidents in the interim too, so how would you objectively show Reagan was responsible. I'm also not entirely convinced the wealth gap is worse, though I'd be willing to look at evidence?

More than sexual objects, sure. Prostitutes and those working in pornography don't do so 24/7. As for their bodies should and shouldn't be used for, you sound like those people who said women shouldn't work outside the home because it's degrading to them, regardless of how they feel about it.

  - If you roll ndm (an m-sided die n times) for n > 1, the result is roughly a normal distribution with mean `n*(1+m)/2` and variance `n*((-1 + m)*(1 + m))/12`. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

  - Using the above, you could approximate the CDF of getting a value (say, 18) by looking at the CDF evalutaed at value minus 0.5 (say, 17.5), the one half to compensate for continuity.

  - You could then find the PDF by taking the finite differences of the CDF.

The problem here is too few people are willing to start businesses and too many want to work for businesses. I think if more people started businesses, they'd start favoring less regulation too.

> actual guidelines in place to keep them from doing exactly that

OK, but I believe freedom is a birthright. Unless you can show a regulation is necessary to prevent violating someone else's rights, it's invalid. It's not a question of whether we ""let"" businesses (or people) do something, it's a question of we have an obligation to preserve their freedom.

> So you believe that business should be prioritized when creating regulations and not people, animals and the environment?

Animals don't have rights. People do have rights and one of those rights is the right to the same quality air as others. I meant ""minimal"" in the sense of not creating regulations that have no benefit but merely punish the business. Minimal in the sense of necessary.",

As an example for the first case, plotting `y` vs `1/x` gives us (with 1/x first then y, although linearity works in either direction) `(1, 3/12), (1/2, 3/16), (1/3, 3/20)`. If we take the slopes between the first two points, we get `(3/16-3/12)/(1/2-1) = 1/8` and between the last two points as `(3/20-3/16)/(1/3-1/2) = 9/40`. Since these slopes don't match, y versus 1/x is not the right answer

There is probably a faster way to do this, but sometimes brute force is the ""easiest"" (not fastest)

  - For n > 3, `2^n (mod 8) = 0` (we can check n= 0, 1, 2 trivially to find `2^0 = 5^0` and `5^1 - 2^2 = 1`
  - `5^m (mod 8)` is 1 when m is even, 5 when m is odd
  - `2^n - 5^m (mod 8) = 0 - {1 or 5} = {7 or 3}` and can therefore never be 1
  - Thus, if a solution exists, we have `5^m - 2^n = 1`. Taking that mod 25 gives us `5^m - 2^n = 1 (mod 25) implies 0 - 2^n = 1 (mod 25) implies 2^n = -1 (mod 25) implies 2^n = 24 (mod 25)`. The powers of 2 mod 25 (including 2^0 = 1) follow the 20-element cycle `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 7, 14, 3, 6, 12, 24, 23, 21, 17, 9, 18, 11, 22, 19, 13`, where `2^10 = 1024 (mod 25) = 24`. Thus, n must be of the form `10 + 20k` for some value of k. Thus, n must be even
  - Take `5^m - 2^n = 1 (mod 8)` gives us `5^m = 1 (mod 8)`. As per step 2 above, this means m must also be even
  - Since both m and n are even we can write them as 2a and 2b respectively for some natural numbers a and b.
  - We then have `5^(2a) - 2^(2b) = (5^a)^2 - (2^b)^2 = (5^a + 2^b) * (5^a - 2^b)`. For that to equal 1, both terms must be 1, so `5^a + 2^b = 5^a - 2^b = 1 implies 2^b = -2^b = 1` which means `2^b = 0` and thus not 1",

People have the right to believe the Holocaust did not exist and the right to express they feel that way (that's a ""worldview"" that Germany's Fascist ideaology suppresses). The whole ""given Germany’s history of fascism and genocide"" is also bullshit: it sounds lie you're punishing modern day Germans for what their ancestors did and that's wrong (punishing a group for actions of another group).

I always thought of the sidereal year as a period of time, not having a specific start or end date. However, quoting the wikipedia article:

>The Indian national calendar, based on the works of Maga Brahmins, as are the calendars of neighbouring countries, is traditionally reckoned by the Sun's entry into the sign of Aries and is also supposed to align with the spring equinox and have relevance to the harvesting and planting season and thus the tropical year.[citation needed] However, as the entry into the constellation occurs 25 days later, according to the astronomical calculation of the sidereal year, this date marks the South and Southeast Asian solar New Year in other countries and cultures

Basically, the March equinox occurs when the Sun reaches the ""first point of Aries"". However, because of precession, this point is actually closer to the Aquarius-Pisces border and quite far from today's IAU definition of Aries. April 14th is apparently the date the Sun enters Aries as it is defined today or somehow corrected for precession.",

  - there are therefore `2^(3^n-1)` possible binary combinations of neighbors.

If you're right, and Muslims are flooding into Europe and having 5+ kids to the European's 0 to 1, they're going to be the majority soon and, may, as you say, change the laws to reflect their beliefs. I'm playing Devil's advocate here because even even large Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia don't have sharia law, since you are painting a scenario that suggests European countries may soon observe sharia law.

Once they outnumber the ""native"" Europeans, they won't have to ""properly integrate into society"". It's their society and you'll have to integrate into it. No huge social problems: the society is still cohesive, it's just no longer ""your"" society.

If you really believe what you say, you should speed up the process by suggesting more Muslims move to Europe, encouraging fertility in Muslim families, and converting people to Islam. That will minimize social problems during the transition period.

Now that might be valid. If you find a correlation by coincidence in an experiment, but then run a second indepedent experiment and get the same correlation, you can be far more confident its a real world phenomena.

However, if you're going to go down this route, I'm going to question whehter most social studies use anything resembling a random sample. Yes, true randomness is unattainable, but I'm guessing most studies aren't even close to random sampling the population on which they want to gather data.

So, we're applying human bias (by deciding on what factors we observe and which ones we ignore), collecting bad data, applying more human bias (by deciding which of the factors we chose to observe are and aren't relevant) and then applying bad logic (past performance implies future performance, extrapolation). That's not good.

> (...)

No, I'd fill in the ... with some crap. Basically, I'd look at some of the data (can't look at it all), make a bunch of assumptions that make things easier, and then send the results to my boss. The more time I had, the more data I'd try to look at, but there's a limit.

>(a) It is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a situation occasioned or developed through no conduct of said driver and which is of sufficient gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the consequences sought to be prevented by this section;

BTW, I do appreciate your recognizing me as a mathematician (or at least as someone who knows some math) instead of treating me like a completely innumerate idiot (I may be an idiot, but at least I'm numerate!).

I should point out ""I don't believe in statistics"" is an exaggeration: I believe most social statistical studies are deeply flawed. I don't have a problem with medical studies on rats and stuff.

Something to consider: in a population of n people there are B(n) ways to partition them into subgroups, where B() is the Bell number. Mathematically, each of these partitions is equally valid. Some of them will have names in English like race, gender, nationality, etc, but most won't. However, the lack of an English name doesn't make these partitions any less important.

Any statistical sample you have, random or otherwise, that doesn't include the entire population, will have anamolies for many of the partitions. For example, if 5% of the US population is born in Texas, your sample may have only 3% born in Texas. You could, of course, adjust by counting the Texas-born votes with a weight of 5/3rds.

But now imagine you do that with every partition (there are issues here, but let's go with it for the moment). My claim is that you'll find your sample set, random or not, cannot fulfill the criteria of having the same distribution as every partition.

Therefore, if your sample IS randomly chosen, you must use it ""as is"" to prevent bias.

Please go ahead and present your example",

I'm going to disagree with your 4-6% risk on the basis of statistics, not studies.

There are many factors that determine whether something (such as birth defects) will or will not occur. If we look at a single factor and ignore the others, we introduce a bias and our results are inaccurate. If we look at all the factors like we should, we'll find that, by symmetry, they tell us nothing.

Of course, past performance doesn't imply future performance either.

Therefore, it is generally inaccurate to say there's a x% chance something will happen when we are considering only some of the many factors. If we consider all the factors, we learn nothing.",

Doing it without rejection sampling was once a competition/challenge problem. The answer is ""easy"", but ugly.

Roll d6s, subtract 1 from the result and treat the successive throws as a base 6 number starting with 0. Stop rolling when you know your base 6 number is stuck in a 5% interval, and use that interval for the d20.

This works if you replace 6 and 20 with almost anything (except maybe 1)

EDIT (example): Suppose you first dial a 3 which translates to `0.2 (base 6)`, which is `1/3` or `0.333... (base 10)`. No matter what you roll from now on, your result will never be lower than `0.2 (base 6)` and, even if you roll 6's forever, you will never get more than `0.255555.... (base 6)` which is `0.3 (base 6)` or `0.5 (base 10)`.

Thus, after rolling a 3, you are ""trapped"" between the numbers `0.333... (base 10)` and `0.5 (base 10)`. To convert a decimal between 0 and 1 to a d20, you can multiply by 20, add 1, and take the floor of the result, so `0.333... (base 10)` translates to `floor(20*0.333...+1) = floor(7.666...) = 7`, and `0.5 (base 10)` translates to `floor(20*0.5+1) = floor(11) = 11`. Therefore, after rolling a 3 your know your final result will be between 7 and 11. Since that's more than one possibility, you roll again.

Suppose you now roll a 4, so your number so far is `0.23 (base 6)` (remember that you subtract 1 from the 4 so the result is in the range 0-5 not 1-6). That means your final result must be between `0.23 (base 6)` and `0.24 (base 6)` which translates to between `2/6 + 3/36 = 0.41666... (base 10)` and `2/6 + 4/36 = 0.444... (base 10)`. Converting to a d20, that's between `floor(20*0.41666... + 1) = floor(8.333... + 1) = floor(9.333...) = 9` and `floor(20*0.444... + 1) = floor(8.888... + 1)  = floor(9.888...) = 9`.

Since those numbers are the same, you treat this as a 9 on a d20.",

However, I was being a bit glib. I've met plenty of people of all ages that aren't mature, and it seems very few people in society are actually mature. My point was that people reach maturity at different times in their life (sometimes never) and may even lose maturity with age (senility being an obvious example).

I'm saying most 16 year olds meet the very low minimum standard of maturity set by our society. This is a logically fallacious ""but you do it too"" argument: if immature 35 year olds have freedoms, why shouldn't less immature 16 year olds have the same freedoms?",

  - We don't care. The OP is just a bunch of text on a screen. If they take our advice and end up miserable, oh well. We have some sympathy sure, but nowhere near the sympathy we feel for people we know in real life.

  - As others have noted, and at least in my experience, people always tell stories slanted in their favor. That's why couples counseling involves, you know, couples.

The strongest ""evidence"" for flat Earth is that there was a time, perhaps before recorded history, that most people believed the Earth was flat, and they had gravity, lunar eclipses and ""changing of the constellations"" (via the ""celestial sphere"")

If a dome is flat, then any hemisphere of the Earth really IS flat, and there's a hemisphere that's almost all water-- maybe the opposite of that hemisphere is our domed Earth and all that water just lies in a trough or something.

Re Q3, the default belief should be the Earth is flat, because it looks flat. Showing it's not really flat requires evidence

Re Q2, some Flat Earthers believe that Antarctica forms a difficult/impossible to cross wall around the Earth, so people who get lost in Antarctica really do ""fall off the edge"": https://img.favpng.com/4/21/25/globe-norman-b-leventhal-map-center-north-pole-flat-earth-png-favpng-1C3h3bQ94sBE2wbfCQV1E4fRK.jpg (closest thing I could find in 1 minute)

Re Q1, I sometimes *pretend* I believe the Earth is flat just to show people that Round Earth is a non-trivial argument",

Well, this might be a definitional issue, but, in democracy, we have the philosophy that the majority is always right, because they're the ones who make the laws.

You are exactly correct. My ""right to freedom"" is everyone else's responsibility not to violate my freedom.

We could tweak a bit to avoid babies from voting (""everyone who understands the concept of having a say has a say""), but that's my definition.

Freedom: the right to do anything that doesn't violate anyone else's rights. However, this argument is circular because it doesn't define ""right"". I would say we have the right to life, liberty, property, and more. When a conflict arises, each party would argue as to which of their rights they feel is being violated, and the court/logicians would decide which of those rights they actually have and whether they are being violated. In theory, you could have a legitimate conflict where logic won't resolve the situation, but, hopefully, those situations are rare.

You are correct that my Hitler example was a bad one. I guess I'm saying, yes, I axiomatically believe the system of government I propose is the best one, regardless of what others think. By declaring this an axiom, I'm saying I can't defend it further than to say it's a fundamental truth.

Abortion is actually a difficult issue and I struggled with it because, as you point out, both the fetus and fetus carrier have rights. You could argue that the fetus carrier owns her womb and the fetus is trespassing, but that contradicts my belief that parents have an obligation to care for their children. I could cheat and say I believe freedom is a BIRTHright, so wouldn't apply to a fetus, but that's cheating.

Ultimately, I believe the fetus has a right to be aborted. Life is hard enough as it is, and being born unwanted just makes it harder. A reasonable person would probably not want to be born with the disadvantage of being unwanted. Therefore, abortion supports the fetus' right not to be born. This raises the ugly question of mandatory abortion, which I will ignore. You could also argue that we expect parents to make the best decisions for their children (except in cases of abuse), so the fetus carries decides, on behalf of the fetus, the best course of action. The counterargument here would be that abortion is abuse, but I would argue euthanasia isn't abuse.

Is she now responsible if someone posts something illegal? I would argue no, because she didn't post it.

The only change I'd make is requiring social media companies to remove material immediately when they're informed it's illegal or could give rise to civil litigation.

I'm saying democracy, as a system of government, believes the majority is, by definition, always right.

I disagree. You can mine data and present it in a way that makes a certain group seem harmful. As you point out some drivers do think speed limits make roads safer (which is provably wrong in the sense road deaths didn't increase after the highway speed limit was increased from 55), and it's this kind of data mining abuse that makes them think that way. So, yes, choosing which subset of empirical data to present and how to present it can harm groups.

> If you want to make a case that speed limits make the road more dangerous

I'm making the opposite case, but that might've been a typo on your part. However, maybe I should pause to ask: what claim are you making? I thought it was that speed limits increase road safety. Is that not the case? Did I confuse you with someone else on this thread?

> seem like you are just assuming the data will agree with you

Well, raising the highway speed limit didn't increase deaths, and if you accept 50% of highway deaths occur when at least one party is driving over the posted limit, and that 90% of people drive at least a little over the posted limit, you've shown driving at our below the speed limit is 2.5 times as dangerous, which means driving below the speed limit should be illegal. I don't believe in that, but that's where statistical arguments lead us. And, while speed is something we can control, it also leads to pro-racial-profiling arguments

My point is that it doesn't matter if the data agree with me, because you can't punish a specific person for the actions of others. Or, if you absolutely insist on doing so, you must do it consistently by examing all factors, including those that aren't easy to express in English.",

I don't think you actually need P1 because ""sometimes"" doesn't mean it necessarily applies in a specific situation. You either need to say ""always"" or just say ""in this specific case"". Overall, however, I agree your logic is valid.

I believe it is unsound because I disagree with more than one of your premises, not just P4:

  - P1: I agree, but would characterize this as conflict of freedoms: there are cases where two or more parties can claim freedom that conflict with each other and we must resolve which one is an actual freedom and which one is a fictitious freedom. I wouldn't say ""small freedom"" vs ""large freedom"" but just ""actual freedom"" vs ""fictitious freedom"", but same concept.

  - P2: No, there is no absolute right to safe roads, just as there is no absolute right to life. If you jump off a cliff or drive under dangerous conditions (eg, dark, raining, low visibility, etc), no person or government has an obligation to save you.

A right is really just someone else's responsibility. So, one person's right to life is, in general, another person's responsibility not to kill that person. So one person's ""right"" to road safety just means other people's obligation to drive safely.

  - P3: I'd say there's no freedom to drive dangerously, so I'd sort of agree. It's not a small freedom: it's not a freedom at all. I'm opposed to reckless driving, so it's a misrepresentation of my position to say I support driving ""literally any speed you want"". Rather, I'm saying that, if you're driving safely, speed is irrelevant.

  - P4: You are correct in saying I disagree with this point. There is no empirical evidence nor can there be any empirical evidence that driving over the posted limit is riskier than not doing so, since future risk is immeasurable. There is also bias in choosing to looking at a specific element to determine if a given instance of driving is dangerous: by the principle of equality you'd have to look at all possible factors. Further, driving over the posted speed limit sometimes decreases risk, so, in some circumstances, your reasoning would require us to punish those driving at or below the posted limit for increasing risk.

I'll also mention that, in my opinion, rights are not absolutes. You can lose your right to life under some conditions. In particular, I would argue that someone who passes or enforces rights-violating laws such as absolute speed limits loses their rights to pretty much everything, including road safety. This doesn't really affect most people since supporting speed limits is different from passing or enforcing them, but I would argue that, ethically, if a person who supports absolute speed limits is harmed on the road, they do not deserve sympathy.",

> you essentially are an anti-emperialist

Well, more the opposite. I believe in looking at ALL empirical data, not just a small subset designed to harm a specific group of people.

For example, a pure racist might look only at race data for crime (eg, racial profiling) because it's highly unlikely all races commit crime at exactly the same rate. I'm saying asking the question ""which race commits the most crime"" is itself racist because you've pre-determined that you want to harm a specific race (even if you haven't decided which race it is yet).

Similarly, when you ask the question ""what is the relation between speed and road safety"", you've already decided that this relation is more important than other factors that affect road safety presumably because you want to harm people who drive at a certain speed.

If you look at all the data, you'll see there are cases where driving faster is safer, but it's unlikely that you'll punish people for driving at the speed limit because your goal was never to actually draw conclusions from the data, but rather draw the data to support your foregone conclusion.

You also know that if you look at the unobservable empirical data (ie, factual data that you don't measure, either intentionally or otherwise), you'll show that you can make no assessment of risk, because symmetry means the empirical data risk will cancel out.

Effectively, you know you can't compute risk from empirical data, so you cherrypick the data to make it appear the data supports your foregone biased conclusion",

I'm still opposed to reckless driving, so this statement is misleading. I believe in eliminating speed limits, yes, but reckless driving would still be illegal

> You can't say that since raisin it by 10mph didn't increase deaths, totally eliminating it wouldn't either

Actually, inductively, it does. If you accept that raising speed limits 10mph (although it was more than that in some cases, including Montana which briefly eliminated them altogether) doesn't increase deaths, then we could do this repeatedly until speed limits were as high as we wanted. I don't accept this argument, but it does follow from the inductive principle.

> Like making murder illegal or having speed limits

I don't think these are similar enough to make a proper analogy.

> you've conceded that if you can make a trade of some freedom for more net freedom, that's a good thing

Per my last message, not exactly with that phrasing, but yes overall. So our disagreement is about driving faster than the posted limit in general specifically, not to the general concept of conflicting freedoms.

The time to reach `27.78 m/s` is `27.78/a` seconds (where `a` is in `m/s^2`). So, after `27.78/a` seconds, the car is at `100km/h` and has traveled `a(27.78/a)^2/2 = 385.86/a`.

So, the greater the acceleration, the less distance the car travels in reaching 100km/h. A car that reaches 100km/h in 32m has an acceleration of `385.36/32 ~ 12.04` meters per second squared.",

Well, OK, have we? I know MESOWEST did a 10-year study on the western USA using randomly selected locations (most of which were in the middle of nowhere) that showed no global warming, but that was a limited time/area study.

If there is a global study of this nature, I've never heard of it (it would be super useful)

Temperatures can change over fairly small distances, but let's say measuring temperature every tenth of a mile would be enough for a gridded approach where we use quantity instead of randomness. Each sensor would therefore cover an area of about 0.0314 square miles. The Earth's surface area is about 197 million square miles, so we would need about 6.2 billion sensors. That's why 20,000 is a meaninglessly small number.

I think my claim is more than measuring global warming using statistics and existing data (which was never collected with the goal of seeing if the Earth is warming) is essentially impossible, so it doesn't matter what approach NASA used.

The same is true of most statistical studies. Once you ask ""if I wanted to study this phenomena, what would I do"", and read the methodology of even a few statistical studies, you'll see they have no hope of being accurate or useful",

Absolutely not. People have the right to negotiate and contract with each other without government interference.

Keep in mind there are people who work purely on commission (not a great idea for them, but certainly a valid form of employment) or get paid on a per-project basis (not hourly)

> If your business cannot manage to pay what the labor of an American worker is worth

In a free market system, workers are automatically paid what they're worth. The problem is that the value of the labor of an unskilled American worker to a company is almost zero, and probably far less than living wage. I think you mean businesses should pay what YOU think the American worker is worth, but that's not really relevant.

This isn't statistically impossible: if you knew all your thermoeters were always giving results exactly 5 degrees higher than the actual temperature, you could easily adjust for that.

To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers

This is saying that the old models are wrong because they incorrectly predicted the amount of CO2 in the air (and ""other climate drivers""). If they ""account[...] for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2"" the models become more accurate. So the models aren't accurate in and of themselves, they are only inaccurate if you tweak them with information that was unknown at the time the model was created

> the ability to make accurate predictions about the world is helpful

Well, if you have 50 models and don't know which one is accurate, which one do you use to make policy decisions.

But let's go a step further. If you accept there are only a finite (but very large) number of possibilities for future climate, then we could consider the set of all of them and guarantee one of them is accurate, but how is that helpful?

> it aligns with what little I do know about the science behind it, because per my experience evaluating scientific literature the body of evidence appears strong and consistent, and because domain experts who understand it much better than I do have drawn that conclusion.
Fair enough, but I don't think you've evaluated scientific literature in this field, you've just read reports of other people's evaluations, which I also question.

Relying on domain experts is the second type of ""appeal to authority"" fallacy: just because someone says they're an expert doesn't mean they are: even experts have to provide evidence to back up their beliefs

>  Us having an intelligent debate on climate change was never on the table because neither of us is anywhere near qualified

Well, show me some of these studies and why global warming is the only reason these things might occur.

Are you now agreeing there is no good DIRECT evidence of global warming and that we have to look at other factors to see whether global warming is occurring?

As a silly note, glaciers melting in water would actually lower sea levels because ice is less dense than water. However, some of the glacial melting comes from glaciers on land so that counterargument doesn't quite work

> the issue is that you don't trust the statistics that underpin this evidence and that distrust is due to an incomplete understanding of statistics

The moment you choose to look at speed (instead of any of the literally trillions of other factors involved in driving in a given place by a given person at a given time), you have introduced bias. You're not going to find a correlation between, say, wind speed and accidents if you don't look at wind speeds.

I'm claiming that a great deal of statistical ""research"" is founded on this kind of bias: the desire to demonize or angelify a group of people or activities leads to the factor you study.

Statistical research is only valid if you consider all factors, which would lead to no conclusions (ie, when done properly, statistics is often useless)

> run diract studies were you limit speed in an area where in 2 similar places you change the speed limit in one and not the other and compare death and accidents. all of these steps prove that speed kills

Ignoring the bias I mention above and the fact that past performance doesn't imply future performance, this would actually be a valid scientific experiment, provided you chose 1000s of locations and randomly decided where to increase or decrease the speed limit.

There's definitely an ethical issue here, but the other issue is compliance. Changing the speed limit won't necessarily change the actual speed people are driving. However, if the goal is to determine what speed LIMIT is safest (perhaps none at all), this would at least be a valid experiment. Can you show anyone has conducted such an experiment?",

This format is commonly used in Unix-like systems for storing hashed passwords in the /etc/shadow file. The salt helps to protect against rainbow table attacks by ensuring that identical passwords hash to different values.

1. If we looked at all drives for all people worldwide over a non-cherrypicked period of time, and looked at:

  - %age of people driving over posted speed limit who got into an accident

  - %age of people driving at or below posted speed limit who got into an accident

are you claiming the first number would be higher? If so, what valid statistical studies do you have to demonstrate this belief. I take a neutral stance saying there isn't enough good information to decide.

Our second argument: even if we could show that speed is IN GENERAL more dangerous, could we use it to morally or statistically justify speed limits and the answer is no for the same reason we can't justify things like racial profiling.

> statistics is a real thing that can prove things

Conversely, if sexual intercourse is involuntarily, you have not agreed to take the responsibility of creating a person and have no obligation to nurture them. And if your lack of nurture leads to their death, that is tolerable.

I believe the methodology used to count studies (or people) who support climate change is itself flawed. For example, searching for ""global warming"" will miss papers that mention ""global cooling"", ""nuclear winter"", ""long term global temperature trends"", etc.

See if you can find a study (on either global warming or the consensus), read the methodology section, and, if you feel the methodology is sufficient to show the conclusion, please link it.

Alternatively, propose a methodology for either and show that someone has experimented using that methodology

In cases like that, I can see the government having the freedom to find the lowest cost provider and change who gets access to government land and resources. As a note, no, the electric company can't triple its prices overnight, at least not where I live. Any changes in tariffs must be approved by the city council. They are also subject to regulation by the state.

For things like food and shelter without capitalism, who pays for these things? Who grows the food? Who builds the shelters? If it's through taxation, what prevents people from abusing the system and becoming freeloaders, or even having as many children as possible, knowing the government will take care of them.

There are options such as euthenasia (assisted suicide) and birth control for people who can't obtain or will not obtain (if born) essential resources. I think capitalism still works if we simply make it easier for starving or otherwise suffering people to take their own lives.

Ultimately, nothing is truly free. If 10 people are in a room with limited oxygen, for example, 1 person can't kill the other 9 for their ""right to breathe (oxygenated) air"", so no, not even air is ultimately free in all situations.

It sort of does. If the majority of Black people believe something (and you seem to be suggesting more than just a majority), that's a lot of people. So you'd have to ask why liberals, who want to help minorities, would oppose that view. Generally, when you want to help people, you agree with their opinions.

I could make up an example. Suppose Black people, weakened by all the Cherry Coke[1] they drink, decide they want to be slaves again. Then you could see where the liberals would try to lift them up and convince them they have value. But there probably isn't enough Cherry Coke[1] in the world for that

Assuming you flatten both states down to sea level (which might not be the correct interpretation-- you might only want to flatten to Idaho's lowest point) and that my calculations below are correct [which someone should definitely double check], flat Idaho is slightly bigger than regular Texas, but smaller than flat Texas.

My methodology: Idaho has an area of 83570 square miles average elevaation of 4921 feet. If we started at sea level and elevated each square mile 4921 feet by placing it on a regular parallelpiped (box), that would require 4 sides of a square each 1 mile long and 4921 feet high, thus increasing the surface area by `4291 ft * 4 miles = ~3.25 miles^2` for every square mile. Of course, we'd still have the original square mile, just a lot higher now, so the new area would be `83570*4.25 = ~271666 square miles`.

Note that the calculation above works even if you use square feet or square meters or any unit of measure you want (the boxes will change size, but the additional added area will be the same). The calculation also works even though Idaho has a non-consistent elevation: a 3000 foot box and a 5000 foot box will add the same area as 2 4000 foot boxes.

Texas has an area of `~268600 mi^2`, which IS smaller, but it also has an average elevation of 1706 feet. Following the same calculations as above, ""flat Texas"" has an area of `~615745 mi^2`, about 127% bigger than flat Idaho",

A common fallacy in the soft sciences is that a large number of extremely poor studies with no validity somehow makes them valid. Or, ""since we can't perform a good study, let's just assume this bad study's results are accurate"". Science doesn't work that way. No good study = no results.",

Not exactly. I'm saying that if scientists looked at every possible partition, they would realize, correctly, that no conclusion can be drawn from partitioning the data.

Why it's unethical: suppose a scientist found that people fitting a specific criteria Y were historically ten times more likely to do X than people not matching criteria Y and let's even accept that past performance implies future performance (which it doesn't). Now, if a person matching criteria Y and another person not matching criteria Y were to come along, it seems like you could say the Y person is 10x more likely to do X than the non-Y person.

However, suppose the Y person is also a member of the group Z (a variable you chose to ignore when publishing your results) which are known to never do X. Your original conclusion would be invalid because you chose not to look at variable Z. In a more realistic example, this is the basis of racial profiling: considering someone's race (and perhaps age and gender) when determining if they are or may commit a crime while ignoring the zillions of other variables that would show they are LESS likely to commit a crime.

> I don't think that every partition is worth investigating

That's where I disagree. By ignoring certain partitions, you explicitly introduce a bias by deciding ""x can't possibly be responsible for poor health, so we'll ignore it"". Mathematically, there will be tons of partitions that, simply by chance (though you wouldn't know it's by chance) would show a high correlation with or against poor health.

> If any relevant variables are not controlled for, this is what the peer review is for

My claim is that peer review isn't good enough, because non-hostile peers are not motivated to find mistakes in the study. And, as above, unless you decide beforehand which variables aren't relevant, you can't statistically determine them.

Experiments on animals are useful, but we're different from those animals, and, from what I've read, animal experiments often involve megadosing animals with substances, which isn't a realistic representation of how humans consume them.

What would be really useful (though maybe impossible) would be a way of showing the error bound between a given study and a theoretically perfect study. There are cases when you can do this (for example, if you know what you're measuring can only change slowly over time and space), but they are rare. If you could make a convincing argument saying: this study is imperfect, but we can show that, even if we could perform a perfect study, the results would be within 5%. However, this seems impossible.",

They don't believe that field has shown any valid results so far, but they do accept that it's worth studying. So, in that sense, astrology is a valid ""science"".

If you accept hard determinism (and a few other related theorems), no two people have exactly the same horoscope (because planet positions are never 100% the same at two different times or locations, even the variance is in microarcseconds or less), so there is necessarily a 1-to-1 correspondance between a horoscope and a person's life. In that trivial way, astrology is probably true, though not useful.

> How can the position of some planets judge someone’s future 

Cumulative effect. They say the side of the mother a doctor stands on has more gravitational effect on a child than any planet, but what if the doctor's position itself is determined by a planet? If you carry this out far enough, you could argue that everything on Earth occurs due to planetary positions and so that even earthquakes and volcanoes ultimately come from gravitational pull of other planets",

True, but this is Reddit. Pointless bickering is the whole point.

I am indeed saying ""I know for an almost fact there's no good scientifically valid evidence of global warming, and I will therefore challenge anyone who claims there is"".

I am implying that the only direct way to determine if global warming is occurring is to first find a testable definition of global warming (which itself isn't easy), and then actually perform the test. That's the experimental part of the scientific method that I think global warming theorists are omitting.

My general comeback to replies is that we simply don't have enough temperature data (not model data) to determine whether the Earth has been warming long-term. Even if we do get accurate data, we have to consider random variation.

Given enough data, this could reduce the number of potential variables affecting diet to just a few important ones.

I disagree. If you have a sample size of n, there are Bell number of n partitions of that sample. To be stastistically accurate, you'd have to examine every such partition as a variable (many of them will sound complicated in human language, but it's a form of bias to assume that human language identifies relevant variables via shorter names). And, if you do measure every such variable, symmetry will tell you that you can gain no knowledge.

The problem with what you're saying is that people performing these studies will say ""we adjusted for k confounding variables, and can't think of any other reason (except the control variable) that would explain the results"". And k is never anywhere near the Bell number of the sample size. It's also academically dishonest to say ""we can't think of any other reason"", since it's obviously in the researchers interest to not find confounding variables they haven't accounted for. At the very least, the study should be reviewed by a hostile panel that would propose additional confounding variables.

Therefore I maintain that, once you throw out random sampling and control, your study isn't valid and can't show causation. Scientists just need to bite the bullet and say ""we don't know and we have no ethical way of finding out""",

I found https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142450/ and my comments:

  - the biggest problem here is that there's no control variable (unless I missed something): you're not randomly telling these people what to eat, you're observing what they already eat, so, at best, you're finding correlation not causation. There are so many other reasons some people die earlier than others and you're not controlling for those

  - the 19,899 participants were volunteers and not randomly selected. This is another basic problem with most human-based social studies: the participants aren't a random sample and the results are therefore statistically invalid. The fact that the male-female ratio is so far off is evidence of the larger problem (the representation of various groups is different in the study than in real life): you can compensate for some of the differences (like gender), but not all of them

  - Of the 19,899 participants, only 335 or 1.7% died. That's a very small percentage. The results for 1.7% of the population are worthless compared to the other 98.3%. I realize the study had a time limit, but, even given its other flaws, it would be more convincing if it tracked all of the participants to death

Not everyone who takes a single puff of a single cigarette will die of cancer. There are even people (non-COPD suspectible) who smoke for a lifetime and die at an old age of something other than cancer.

Even the warning of cigarettes (at least back in the day) just said smoking cigarettes may increase the risk of cancer, a statement that's provably false since there's no way of measuring risk.

The problem: when people make statements like the above, others assume they're saying cigarettes are safe. Not at all. You can say: there's a lot of evidence to show that cigarette smoking is dangerous to some people, but no actual proof. Some people can smoke for an entire lifetime without negative health effects, whereas others can contract cancer from relatively low doses of tobacco products.

In the case of junk food, 1) you said ""lack of micronutrients"", which is not an issue (we assume the quantity of food consumed compensates for the lack of micronutrients per serving), and 2) genetic metabolism is one of many examples of something that's responsible for weight or how much or what people eat.",

I believe neighborhoods should at least consider being privatized so they contain no public land.

Keep in mind charities exist, and they're the ones who should be showing compassion. The government shouldn't control my compassion

I'm arguing they should be taxed even less: an equal dollar amount. Even with lower tax rates for the rich, they are seriously overpaying.

Your argument might work if you insisted on extreme separation of Church and State, but, since many people's moral values are based on religion, I don't think this would work.

As a hyper-counter-example, you can't expect the Pope to make laws based on how well they'd objectively improve the Holy See: his job is to spread and enforce the will of God.

Suppose a psuedoscientist showed that voluntary or even mandatory abortions would objectively improve the world. A religious politician wouldn't have to say ""no, my calculations show it would make the world worse"", but rather ""however, anyone who supports abortions will go to hell, and anyone who doesn't fight against abortions may as well-- your post-life destination is far more important than any brief Earthly comforts""",

The opposite is true. The more the meal costs, the less money I have for tipping. Remember, restaurants sometimes charge Doordash customers more, not to mention Doordash's own service and delivery fees. We're playing plenty already.

But then the meal isn't cheap any more :)

I'm not broke. I can afford to pay for the food at a premium price, I can afford to pay Doordash's service fees, and even delivery fees (except I have Dashpass, but same thing). Maybe it's not a question of having the money, but just not wanting to tip.

  - It's easier nowadays to report smaller disasters and disasters in unpopulated areas. Historically, only large disasters in populated areas were reported. We'd need to adjust for this change. Also, the further back we go in history, the less information is preserved, and we must adjust for that as well

  - We need to make sure we list all disasters even remotely related to climate. Cherrypicking disasters that have increased in quantity while ignoring those that have decreased would be biased

  - We need to determine the mean and standard deviation of the number of each disaster to make sure we're not just seeing random fluctuation.

  - We need to weight disasters by severity, but carefully. For example, an earthquake today may kill more people because population is higher, but still be lower on the Richter scale than a historical earthquake

  - Because our ability to measure pheomena accurately has increased, we need to adjust for lower precision in the fast. We also cannot assume the errors balance out since lack of precision doesn't always have a mean of zero.",

> A 2014 National Crime Victimization Study found that nearly a quarter (24%) of all domestic violence victims were men, while DomesticShelters.org cites that less than 15% of abuse victims are men. This lack of consistency could be due to differing definitions of what constitutes domestic violence and using different parameters to collect and categorize the data.

However, 15% is still high.

> The National Domestic Violence Hotline, for example, reports that 1 in 10 men aged 18 and older in the US experience rape, physical violence, and/or stalking. They then also break it down to 1 in 7 men who experience severe physical violence by an intimate partner alone, versus 1 in 19 men who experience stalking, and 1 in 71 who experience rape

The 1 in 10 and 1 in 7 numbers are inconsistent, so I have to assume the 1 in 7 means ""of the 1 in 10, 1 in 7 of those"" which brings it down to 1 in 70.

> Multiple sources conclude that psychological aggression is the most common form of abuse experienced by men

This is problematic. While I don't support psychological aggression, I see it as less of a problem than physical assault and battery. I realize psychological aggression can include threats of violence (assault), I think actual physical violence is more of a concern.

> DomesticShelters.org reports that 26% of gay men and 37% of bisexual men, or 2 in 5 gay or bisexual men overall, experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime.

This at least suggests those instigating violence are male. That doesn't contradict your point that men are victims, but does suggest that most or many abusers are males.

As you said yourself:

> Obviously women are still at much higher risk for the worst outcomes such as murder which is important. But male victims are definitely not the tiny fringe exceptions to the rule that they are commonly portrayed as.

So the question would be: weighting for severity, how much more violence is directed towards women than men.

Another major issue is defining assault and violence: statistics are helpful, but, at some point, we need to know what actually happened and have an independent party decide whether it constitutes assault",

I know there's more to what you linked but 40 is a very small sample size and the fact that fewer than 50% completed the study invalidates even those results.

But let me go back to my original question: what sort of experiment would show whether or not weight loss results in increased overall physical and mental health? Before finding studies, at least figure out what the study SHOULD do.

I'm also going to cheat slightly and ask a different question: does *attempting* to lose weight increase or decrease health? Here, I would argue that people who lose a lot of weight and gain it back (the most common outcome of weight loss attempts) actually end up less healthy than before since rapid weight loss is dangerous.

Finally, even if you could show that, historically, weight loss has in general resulted in increased health, how can you show it will help a given individual without looking at other factors?",

The only way to really fix AI is to explain to it EVERY logical fallacy and EVERY statistical fallacy, and tell it to ignore any argument or decision that is based on a fallacy. That'll essentially lobotomize it to where it can't make any decisions at all, because when you get right down to it, there are no fundamentally correct decisions.

According to https://usafacts.org/articles/the-latest-government-data-on-school-shootings/ 327 in the 2021-22 school year. That's more than one per school day.

I admit I'm shocked, though, if you're forced to think about it logically, there a LOT of schools in the USA, blah blah, blah.

Plowing on with statistics, the data on https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/school-enrollment/2022-cps.html (the ""All Races"" spreadsheet) there are 75 million children enrolled in school in the United States.

It's hard to estimate the number of CEOs in the United States, since you could argue that, in a one-person business, the one person is technically also the CEO. Assuming we mean large company CEOs, https://ceoworld.biz/2024/01/13/the-worlds-most-influential-ceos-and-business-executives-of-2024/ says they compiled data on ""almost 3,000 CEOs from all over the world"", which, because I'm getting bored, we will say are all the large business CEOs in the world. The US has less than 5% of the world's population, but it's unlikely CEOs are distributed evenly around the globe, so let's say 25% of 750 in USA.

Now, continuing with this garbage calculation, there are 100,000 as many kids as CEOs. Assuming 327 shootings led to about 1000 deaths, we can expect about 0.01 CEO deaths per year.

I mostly made these caculations because I like math. It's unlikely they bear any resemblence to reality.",

If you really want to compare, you'd have to define what you mean by unhealthy. There are lots of ways to do this, which creates a problem: McDonald's might be healthier then Little Caesar's under one metric but less healthy under another.

If you're too ""lazy"" to do this yourself, you can google around and probably find articles that compare how unhealthy food is based on various factors, and hopefully provide the raw data/research that reaches that conclusion. However, you're unlikely to find 100% agreement.

Finally, you'll run into people like me who question whether food can be defined as healthy or not, because I don't believe the statistics that show certain ingredients or types of calories are bad for you.

My counter arguments:

> ""Cook more to save money, be healthy, and maybe even have fun and learn a new skill"" is good advice for most people.

True, but the person who said that later said they didn't enjoy cooking, which turns one positive into a negative. I was just saying that, if you don't like cooking, the health and monetary benefits are, *for most people*, *in my opinion*, not worth it. Of course, that's situational. If you're poor or on a heavily restricted diet, cooking ""under duress"" may still have net benefit.

> if not eating fast food is your idea of suffering, actuarially speaking you'll be suffering plenty later in life. 

Fast food tastes awesome, so, yes, not eating it could be considered suffering. I hate actuaries and statistics, and do not accept your belief that fast food necessarily leads to suffering in later life.

> maximize long-term enjoyment

Disagree, call dead guy philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) to the stand. Felicific calculus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus) suggests long-term enjoyment should be just one factor in decision making. Other types of pleasure must be considered too.

Most of your second paragraph is a red herring because that's not what I'm arguing. I'm say, on the whole, for people who don't enjoy cooking, forcing themselves to cook is an overall negative.",

  - ""getting drunk"": Clarify if you mean any social drinking or a specific level of ""drunkeness"". Accusing people who drink socially of being ""drunk"" could be offensive. Try ""am not interested in alcohol or drugs"" or something.

  - ""hooking up with strangers"": There's a difference between having casual sex with acquaintences and ""strangers"". Perhaps just say you're not interested in casual sex

  - ""sex with random people"": again a bit offensive (and mathematically incorrect, though that's probably not an issue); you can again just say ""casual sex""

  - ""slept around"": a very negative way of saying ""enjoys recreational sex with a variety of partners""

  - ""find out the other person was promiscuous"": this implies you get into a relationship without asking about someone's sexual history and then leave them if you find out they've slept with a lot of people. Maybe find that out first

""I'm not into clubbing, drugs and alcohol and casual sex. Is it morally acceptable for me to seek a partner with similar values?""

You don't have to use those words exactly, of course, but avoid the implication that people who don't meet your personal standard are inferior as human beings vs just being potentially poor partners for you.

From a practical standpoint, having a partner with the same values as you is a good thing, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if they previously had different values, especially if you are both young. People can change quite a bit while growing up",

That's different from saying ""being fat is healthy"". It's just saying weight loss isn't the only path to health. As a trivial example, cutting down on sodium (ie, sodium-based compounds) can (presumably) make you healthier even though sodium has no calories.

Another argument is that weight loss is difficult and stressful and most people who try to lose weight fail. Putting yourself through all that stress for no result is unhealthy. Therefore, remaining heavy could actually be healthier than trying to lose weight.

My argument (not commonly accepted) is that there's no actual evidence that weight loss increases health, and, if you include things like mental health, even successful weight loss could decrease health. If you want to disagree with me on this, please carefully read what I said, and explain how you would conduct a study to determine whether successful weight loss increases health.",

So let's move on to the concept of labor. To provide everyone with ""basic needs"", would have you have to force some people to labor for the benefit of others? I'm sure some would do so voluntarily but others wouldn't without compensation. Do you see a way of meeting everyone's ""basic needs"" without enslaving people?

I didn't address it earlier, but the other point is somewhat valid too: if you give birth to a child knowing that you won't be able to care and provide for it, that could be considered a form of child abuse.

Air has a density of `~1.293 kg/m^3` so the air mass is `203.88 m^3 * 1.293 kg/m^3 ~ 263.62 kg`. That seems heavy so I double checked: per the ideal gas law, 1 mole of gas takes up 22.4 L at STP, and `203.88 m^3 = 203880 L`, so that's approx 10000 mol and the molar mass of nitrogen is about 28g, so it works out.

The specific heat of air is `1.005 J/(g*K)` where K is in Kelvin. Since 50F to 70F is 10C to 21C, that's an 11 degree change in Kelvins, so `1.005 J/(g*K)*11K ~ 11.06 J/g`.

Thus it would require `11.06 J/g * 263.62kg ~ 2.916*10^6 J` of energy total, though only if the heater is 100% efficient (which it isn't since it also generates light) and we only heat the air not the walls, and there's no new cold air coming in or heat escaping, etc, etc, etc.

Space heaters run at pretty high wattage, say 1500W, so, under ideal circumstances, you could heat the room in `2.916*10^6 J/1500W ~ 1944 seconds` or around 32 minutes.

Note that, if you didn't want to look them up, you could get both the mass and specific heat of air using the Ideal Gas Law",

EDIT: Looking over https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/labeling-and-warning-statements-tobacco-products/cigarette-labeling-and-health-warning-requirements I believe most of these warnings are deceptive because they use the words ""cause"" deceptively, since not everyone who smokes will have these issues. ""Can hypothetically cause"" or ""may cause"" would be more accurate, but is still extremely biased.

I'm opposed to compulsory speech, and believe that consumers should understand the risks of using any product they consume.

I'd like to see tobocco companies (and this might even be legal) explain the processes by which the Surgeon General makes these determinations and point out the serious logical and statistical flaws in these studies, as well as deliberately deceptive studies and statements. Similarly, I'd like to see benefits of smoking (such as weight loss and the potentially destressing properties of nicotine), though I do realize the benefits are usually not worth the risks.

I'd also like tobocco companies point out there are plenty of other risks that may lead to the specified diseases/dangers to avoid making it seem like smoking is the only issue.

The fundamental problem with most studies involving people is that they assume past performance implies future performance (time extrapolation) which isn't necessarily true, and that correlation implies causation.",

An annual rate of 3.90% means you get `3.90%/12 = 0.325% per month` or `$566.80 * 0.325% = $1.84` per month.

However, since you said annual percentage YIELD, that means you get 3.90% total per year. If that amount is compounded monthly, you get a rate `r` per month where `(1+r)^12 = 1+3.90%` yielding `r = 0.319331%` or a monthly payment of `$566.80 * 0.319331% = $1.81` for the first month. Of course, the next month you'll have `$566.80 + $1.81 = $568.61` in your account and get the same `0.319331%` on that so it'll be a slightly larger amount.

The paragraph I added about ties is also incorrect. I'm leaving the answer up just for reference.

~~In the general case, given n > m, there's a 1/m chance you'll roll a k on the m-sided die (for any value of k between 1 and m), and a (n-k)/n chance the n-sided die will beat it. Therefore, we sum (Mathics format):~~

~~Sum\[(1/m)\*(n-k)/n, {k, 1, m}\]~~

~~which simplifies to (-1 - m + 2 n) / (2 n).~~

~~In your case, n=12 and m=8 yielding 5/8. However, since you want the d8 to beat the d12, it's 1-5/8 or 3/8 or 37.5%~~

~~The chance of tying is:~~

~~Sum\[(1/m)\*(1/n), {k, 1, m}\]~~

~~which is simply 1/n or 1/12 in your case. That adds 8.333...% to give a total chance of \~45.83% of tying or beating, which is close to the 44% you got.~~

to make it appear as though infant mortality due to disease HAS decreased, and the majority of infant mortality occurs for other reasons.

However, the two sites are actually talking about different time periods, so my argument isn't really valid.

Instead, I'll suggest that it's at least possible that infant mortality due to disease is either decreasing or has always been fairly low, which would suggest genetics is working.

I can't see genetics helping as much with poverty and famine (not to mention wars and natural disasters), so I could see why those would remain the main causes of infant mortality",

That's an interesting interpretation of the definition of property, but I'm not sure everyone would agree with it:

  - If you accept anti-drug and anti-prostitution laws, you already agree that the government can limit what you can do with your own body

  - Even if you're libertarian, you accept that people can't hit each other, which again limits your use of your property when it harms another. In the case of abortion, harm to another is obvious

  - The government can't seize property without ""just compensation"", implying they CAN seize it with proper compensation. While the government isn't paying women to not get abortions, the general principle applies: we don't really own our own property

Of course, the Supreme Court has made some very strange interpretations of the Constitution. Ultimately, their opinion is the one that counts

These two contradict each other. Most people will never have a wide enough variety of experience to make valid generalizations. You can't ""learn from experience"" unless you mean looking at the experiences of millions of people, and even that has statistical issues

> what purpose does stupidity serve?

Nowadays, people won't accept ""all X are bad because I once met a bad X"" because even the common (stupid) man is smart enough to know generalizations are false and discriminatory.

So you have to appeal to psuedoscience, since that's a form of stupidity many people still accept.

> A stupid person is one who causes harm to another person or group without at the same time obtaining a benefit for himself or even damaging himself

Maybe, but only because it's really hard to change people's minds. I'd argue that many stupid people are TRYING to obtain a benefit for themselves in the sense of changing people's opinions, but they usually don't succeed.

The word Negro itself is offensive as is the word ""colored"", but we still have the Negro Leagues historically, and the United Negro College Fund and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Outside of those and similar references, Negro and colored are offensive.

And before the Spainards attack me (I never expect them), the word 'negro' or 'negra' to mean the color black in Spanish is fine.",

I'm making up the numbers below, but the point still holds:

  - We find that 70% of people who use hard drugs had used marijuana prior to using hard drugs

  - Some people read this as '70% of people who try marijuana end up using hard drugs', but that's not what that means

  - We later find that about 80% of the population has used marijuana at some point in their life

  - Based purely on statistics, we could now say that using marijuana means it's LESS likely that you'll use hard drugs, but this is a historical statement that may not hold in the future

You could therefore conclude that making marijuana usage mandatory would lessen the hard drug problem, but this is also bad statistics.

No one, not even people who use marijuana, really wants to argue that marijuana should be mandatory, so you didn't hear the argument above that often.

There was a similar case where some Christians claimed D&D resulted in teenage suicide, but it turns out the rate of teenage suicide among D&D players was LOWER than the rate of teenage suicide in general. Again, the Christians didn't exactly start encouraging D&D play :)",

  - driving is a right not just a privilege

  - we should legalize pretty much all recreational substances

  - we should go back to the dictionary definition of pedophilia and not regard sex with 16-24 year olds (or others who are physically and mentally mature regardless of age) as pedophilia

  - intelligence can not be accurately measured on a continuous scale

  - there is virtually no objective truth: almost everything is an opinion

What did you actually say and what did the supervisor accuse you of saying? Did you clarify to the store manager what you actually said?

Since you admit to having ""mouthed off"" to a supervisor, the actual words you used may not matter: even if the store manager accepts you didn't use certain specific curse words, it sounds like you were still unprofessional, so the ultimate result was the same.

I view science as a quasi-religion, so I'm worried that forcing science on children is a form of religious indoctrination.

I understand people collect and curate data. Not all of this data is accurate because of instrument inaccuracies (including poor siting) and some of the data has been modified years after being measured, and I'm not convinced these cancel out. In other words, we have data, some of which is inaccurate

However, even if we have/accept accurate date, I'm primarily disagreeing with the conclusion that this shows global warming is occurring. That's where my ""spreading misinformation"" comment comes in. Some overly simplified examples:

  - ""The temperature in Denver is 50F and the temperature in New York is 42F. Therefore, the average temperature in the USA is 46F."". Bad geographic conclusion reached from factual data

  - ""Yesterday, the high in Denver was 52F. Today it is 53F. Therefore the high temperature in Denver is increasing 1F per day"". Bad time-based conclusion reached from factual data

When I asked for a definition of global warming, I meant a scientifically testable one, not something as vague as the UN's definition.

I don't believe in googling in situations like this because google gives too many answers. If there's a specific experimental paper you'd like me to look at that lists its methodology, I can skim it. Generally, the methodology is weak.

If you want to end this (but why, we're having so much fun), I should point out I reject most statistical conclusions reached by most papers (large categories of exceptions apply) because I feel the data is obtained or interpreted incorrectly. I sometimes colloquially say ""I don't believe in statistics"". That might be reason enough for you to stop answering me.",

Reasoning is using known data to arrive at provably correct conclusions. The standard example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Reasoning like that comes from logic and is the realm of pure mathematics.

Another example: if you spin a fair 6-sided die 666666 times, it will come up ""4"" *approximately* 111111 times, but more likely a range around that number than the number exactly. Problem: there are no fair die in the real world: it's probably impossible to create one. Therefore, when people make scientific calculations about dice in the real word, the ""scientific reasoning"" assumptions is that the dice are fair.

Other assumptions science makes that aren't pure reasoning:

  - Scientific theories are likely to continue working. When Newton came up with the Laws of Motion, he never realized they were only approximately true and subject to the laws of Special Relativity that Einstein would discover later. Someone said the half-life of a scientific fact is about 7 years (don't know how, but Stephen Fry quoted them on QI), meaning about half of what we know today will be shown false within 7 years. While whoever said it was speaking very generally, if we take it literally, it means over 99.9% of what we know will be false in 70 years. Even if we don't take it literally, the idea that science is truth is bad reasoning. It's more accurate to say science is truth based on what we now, but probably not absolute truth

  - Scientific theories are the same over space and time for the most part. For example, we believe the Andromeda Galaxy is similar to ours, has stars that are mostly balls of plasma comprised of hydrogen spewing out hydrogen. And we're probably right. However, Andromeda is very far away and, assuming you accept the speed of light is fixec (another assumption) we're looking at it 2.5 million years ago. To reason that Andromeda is similar to our own galaxy, we must accept that stars work the same far away and a long time ago. That's not something we can prove: it's just something science assumes

  - No greater intelligence created what we see. Scientists can explain how the galaxy and stars and planets and moons were formed based on how they look now and figuring out what could've led to them being this way. Of course, it's possible some sort of God creature just created all these things and then vanished. Science automatically discards the possibility of a greater intelligence and strives to explain things assuming no such intelligence. Again, that's something you can't get through pure reasoning. Another way to say this: scientists like to minimize the amount of ""magic"" required for things to happen.

Of course, there are plenty of scientists who make logical and statistical fallacies in their work, but that's just bad science. The points above are the ones even good science makes.",

I actually do know how they estimate historic global temperature (using gridding to avoid clustering issues) but they're using discrete non-randomly-sampled time and space data, so there's no way the result can be accurate. Combine that with new stations being built all the time, and gets even worse.

My goal was to show there is no statistical method that can use the existing data to come up with historical average global temperature. I was hoping the generic statement ""it's impossible with given data"" would cover the (incorrect) way they actually do it.

I am aware of climate modeling to estimate global temperature, but models depend heavily on assumed initial conditions. I'm convinced that, with a little tweaking, someone qualified (not me) could create models that show the Earth is cooling, because I believe models like these are chaotic in the sense they're subject to the butterfly effect

I also know we're getting better at using satellites to determine air temperature, but that's very recent.

The correct way to estimate global temperature over a day is to either have a tight grid of continuously reporting stations (probably impossible) or take and monitor a large but fixed random sample. We've done neither.

The problem I was hoping to avoid was having to ""prove a negative"". I've listed some ways climatologists could try to measure global temperature and why they don't work. However, I can't list every possible theoretical method. What I'm saying is the data available is insufficient to determine global temperature. 

From what you said about comparing two numbers to determine increase, I don't think you understand time series data well enough to discuss it (unless you were deliberately grossly oversimplifying). You need to talk about things like mean and standard deviation and goodness of fit

I have also looked at papers that claim 90% agree: some of them look for phrases like ""global warming"" in papers while ignoring ""global cooling"" (a concern in the 70s), ""global temperature change"", ""global climate trends"", and other phrases that might show papers disagreeing with global warming. They also limit their search to a narrow field, even though other related fields (and purely statistical analyses) might exist and shed doubt on global warming.

You're also making arguments based on ""the majority agree"" or ""an expert said it but without explanation"", both of which are logical fallacies.

Finally, maybe you're right in saying I'm not addressing your points, because I'm not sure what those points are.",

Let's say you *believe* you have very high standards for objectivity, but, based on the rest of your message, I don't agree with you.

Agreed. However, those policies are ignored or actively violated, so that doesn't really help.

> right wing politics have dipped hard into populist rhetoric that doesn't really align with the objective information coming out of academic sources

I don't think academic sources necessarily provide objective information (though there are a lot of schools out there, so I don't think either of us should generalize), but let's go through your examples

> Trump is lying

Trump isn't necessarily lying. It's possible he honestly believed there was voter fraud and was expressing his honest opinion

> there's no evidence of voter fraud

False. Every election has some degree of voter fraud. Ultimately, there wasn't enough evidence of voter fraud to overturn the election.

Lack of evidence isn't evidence of lack. It's possible there actually was enough fraud to overturn the election, but no one found enough evidence

White people, however, can't really live in most of Africa or Australia because their skin is too pale and they burn too easily. Sure, they can live inside buildings and stuff, but they have to be careful to avoid exposure.

So, the people who moved to Europe were the ones who couldn't handle living in Africa.",

Data can't show this because future ""likelihood"" can't be measured. You could only say that, historically, immigrants over a given period of time have been convincted of more crimes per capita than people born in the United States.

I actually thought the opposite was true (immigrants commit fewer crimes per capita), so I'd like a source, but let's continue assuming the paragraph above is true.

The data you're presenting is inherently biased because you're only using immigration status to determine crime per capita. You do sort of correct for this by mentioning socioeconomic status, but that's not enough. Statistically, the only fair way to judge someone is to consider EVERY subset they're a member of. There are Bell number ways to partition a set, and I'm claiming that, mathematically, you must consider all of them, which, because of symmetry, will tell you nothing.

You're also assuming past performance implies future performance, which is statistically invalid.

As a general question, what do you plan to do about other groups of people whose crime rate per capita has been higher than other groups? For example poor people (people of lower socioeconomic status) who were born in the USA?

> we should instead be more strict, and slow down immigration

As above, the data doesn't show that at all. The data doesn't (and can't) show that immigrants may not greatly improve our country, especially since there are different kinds of immigrants. Not all immigrants are equally likely to commit crimes.

So, even if you ignore moral and ethical issues (I, personally, support open borders), data does not give us the ""right answer"".",

That's not true. There are plenty of people who have clinical depression who haven't been diagnosed yet. Self-diagnosis isn't ideal, but it's not always wrong. Many people who self-diagnose as autistic (usually high functioning autism) ARE actually autistic but don't have or want a doctor's diagnosis since high-functioning autism doesn't necessarily always need treatment.

The answer is `Binomial[10,7]*p^7*(1-p)^3`, where Binomial is the binomial coefficient (""10 choose 7"").

If you graph this function, it does peak at 70%, but if you average by taking `Integrate[p*f[p], {p,0,1}]/Integrate[f[p],{p,0,1}]`, you'll see the answer is 8/12 (which simplifies to 2/3).

In general, if there are k successes out of n trials, the average of the integral will be `(k+1)/(n+2)`.

If we ever get to a point where a large minority of people LITERALLY can't afford to live, we'll end up voting in people who will raise the minimum wage, increase welfare, or do whatever it takes to satisfy their constituents.

Of course, we have majority voting in the United States, but if a large minority can't afford to live, there will likely be enough people who are either empathetic or close enough to being unable to live that they'll vote in wage/welfare increasing candidates.",

Actually, I think you've made my point for me. If I buy 1 lottery ticket (do something minor to lose weight), it doesn't cost much but I probably won't get much either.

If I buy 50K lottery tickets (make a vigorous effort at weight loss), it costs a lot more AND I'll still probably not win the big money.

I'd argue most people who try to lose weight long-term don't, and the pain/effort they make is just wasted. If I'm going to not win the lottery, I want to spend $1, not $50K.

I'll go further and argue that even people who successfully lose weight and keep it off may be ultimately worse off than if they'd never lost weight. I don't buy into the whole ""fat people are jolly"" thing, but a drastic change in lifestyle isn't always a good thing

> So you do want the reward, but without putting in the work

Exactly. Why should I pay more for the same ""product"" (weight loss). This is just common sense: least effort for greatest reward.

  - elevation data at 1/9th second resolution for parts of the USA (example: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d0aeaf1e4b0e3d311602697), also elevation data from SRTM1 and other sources, about 867GB total

  - about 529GB of networking data from RIPE (registrar), including daily reverse DNS zones, but I no longer remember what I wanted it for

  - 30 second song samples from spotify, about 511GB

  - Genome/genetic data from NIH, about 369GB

  - mutliple full copies of openstreetmap.org data, about 229GB

  - Climate and weather data, including hourly ISD worldwide and per-minute ASOS for specific US locations; also GHCND and worldclim.org data, 214GB total

  - VSOP data to compute planetary and satellite positions long term including the NOMAD1 star dataset, about 207G

  - National Register Information System data of historic sites, about 165GB

  - population data from worldpop.org and GPW, about 155GB

  - prime numbers, about 52GB

  - Other data that's not super big but that I'm interested in personally: Koeppen-Geiger climate, ESACCI landcover and landuse, solar energy availability, ethnicity data, administrative data (gadm.org), and animal habitat data (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)

Your calculation is a bit off if you mean the same minute AND the same year. There were about 135.63 million people born in 1993 (https://ourworldindata.org/births-and-deaths) which works out to about 258 people per minute. There's no need to compensate for time zones since it's only 9:03am in a small part of the world at any given time, and the 258 represents the sum across all time zones.

So, there were about 258 people born the same minute as you. If we assume some doctors/hospitals round to the nearest 5 or even 15 minutes, the number of people whose birth certificate shows 9:03am exactly would be smaller.

Most of these people would still be alive, but given that there are 8 billion people in the world, only 1 in about 31 million would have the same birth minute as you. That works out to about 10 people in the USA.",

That’s what you’re saying? You’re literally saying that medical science based predictions are inaccurate? How can you be a person of intelligence but also someone who thinks the workings of the human body are a completely random mystery?

Yes, that's what I'm saying expect for the ""completely random mystery"" part. We know quite a bit about how the human body works and that's useful for medical procedures and prescription medication.

I reject the concept of risk at a statistical level because it can't be computed or verified without making assumptions and these assumptions are based on human bias, not mathematics.

> Just say you’re too lazy to work out and too undisciplined to eat well

I'm intelligent enough to realize that exercise and ""healthy"" eating, both short-term and long-term, are vastly more harmful to my mental health and wellbeing than any benefit they could possibly provide. Happy now?

> physical fitness makes your body more efficient

Not really useful unless there's a famine in which case my fat might help me survive longer even at a higher burn rate. If you mean universal entropy, working out increases that more than remaining sedentary

> lowers your resting heart rate

Who cares?

> and vastly improves sexual function

Pornhub has enough money.

> Those things are all worth it to me

The ""to me"" part should be emphasized, but you chose really terrible examples. Most people want to get fit because they have more energy, more stamina, more strength, longer lifespan, etc. Two of the three examples you chose: more efficient body and lower resting heart rate have no direct benefit for you.

> measurable and observable scientific truth

Only if you're using ""scientific truth"" in the sense of ""religious truth"": a truth if you accept the (provably false) assumptions of science, but not necessarily an actual truth in observable real life.",

They have no obligation to do so. In general, people should not take responsibility for the actions of others

Why? We didn't exactly assimilate with the native population either. And maybe they feel their culture is better (not the religious part) and want to help us improve.

> In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, streaming media company Roku, Inc. revealed that around a quarter of the company's cash reserves—$487 million—were held by SVB.[114] Other companies affected by the collapse include video game developer Roblox Corporation, video hosting service Vimeo,[115] and payroll processor, Rippling.[116][117]

so you may have a point, but these look like corporate holdings, not individual holdings. I'm not sure why these companies thought putting more than the FDIC-insured amount into a bank account was a good idea, but they did get reimbursed so I guess it worked out for them.

I'd still argue that MOST of the CEOs' multi-billion dollar wealth is based on their stock holdings, and, as others have hinted, if they actually tried to convert it to cash, they'd get a lot less since the price would fall as they sold off their stock, perhaps even before they did since they have to announce sales and purchases in advance",

When I was growing up, you weren't supposed to have a good time at work. Work was something you tolerated in order to get money so you could have a good time when you were not working. If you enjoyed your job, that was just a bonus.

You also got paid more to be subordinate, not just for your skills. For example, I'm retired and code for fun, but wouldn't want to code for money again because that means I'd have to do it THEIR WAY. Or, to be a bit more crude, you get paid to take their shit.

I'd disagree. ""Challenges"" is a nice way of saying ""disagrees"", and disagreeing with someone means you are starting an argument.

I understand some people enjoy disagreeing and discussing alternative viewpoints, but, ultimately, that's still arguing. You can call it ""debate"" or ""adversarial discussion"" or whatever, but it's ultimately the same thing.

Some people are happy to do it, others feel their opinion is the only correct one. The latter will argue with you. I'd say most people are pretty stubborn in terms of believing their opinion is the only right one and will argue with anyone who disagrees.

Polygraph tests aren't necessarily statistically independent. If they were, even if they were only 51% accurate (or any number over 50), you could just have someone take them repeatedly until you met any required degree of accuracy.

However, if someone can lie successfully on a polygraph test today, they can probably do it again tomorrow and the next day and so on. And, if they can lie on a polygraph test more than 50% of the time, they'll eventually be acquitted, even if the tests are independent.

You could also argue that being forced to take a polygraph test violates the ""no self-incrimination"" rule in the Bill of Rights, so it could only be used if the defendant chooses to use it, which a defendant is more likely to do if they're innocent, meaning the false positive rate (accusing someone of lying when they're not) would be an issue",

I'm eating popcorn when watching movies (or youtube or twitch streams), food is present at most social events, food makes me feel better when I'm down, food satisfies my oral fixation for breasts (the one we're all presumably born with), and so on.

You have to look at your life and ask: for every time I'm eating (not just at major meals), what could I be doing instead? Smoking or vaping might work but that just makes things worse. Playing with a fidget spinner? Yelling at the screen explaining to the characters why what they're doing is wrong? Eating only low calorie high-fiber food that tastes like cardboard? Eating highly seasoned low calorie food (probably also not good for you).

If you're like me, you'll eventually realize life is meaningless and go back to eating more: at least food gives you something.",

So, at 60 degrees north (where cosine is conveniently 1/2) it takes 2 degrees of longitude travel to match 1 degree of latitude travel. Mercator maps are conformal (angle preserving) so this ""2 degrees east, 1 degree north"" is going to look like a 45 degree line pointing northeast.",

I don't believe we can accurately measure average global surface temperature at all (at least until recently), so I view these conclusions as inherently meaningless.

I know some organizations claim to have measured average global surface temperature, but these methods are based on non-randomly-sampled point data and are statistically unsound

> you think that there already isnt extremely well established observations that the surface temperature of the planet has been steadily rising since the Industrial Revolution

Yup, that's exactly what I think. If you look at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/1925/ (which I realize isn't the only source of 1925 weather data), you'll see 7 stations listed. How are you going to get average surface temperature from that?

You can do this algorithimically by considering all terms whose exponents sum to n as n increases. Once you've computed these variables, do a standard best fit linear regression.

You'll eventually get an accurate enough fit, but you may also want to look at the terms to see if they form a pattern that matches a  well-known power series or something",

My ""go to"" on this now dhmo.org -- they sort of set the standard on how easily valid data and factual statements can be grossly misused.

As a statistician (I claim no credentials, I just like the way the word sounds), I believe there is insufficient evidence to show the globe is warming, to show the globe is cooling, and even that the globe is remaining at the same temperature. This sounds like a contradiction but it works in statistics: sometimes the data isn't sufficient to reach any conclusion.

The word infinity is used in many different ways in mathematics, and the definition is slightly different in each case. Some examples:

  - The set is infinitely large means you can make a 1-to-1 onto function from the set to a proper subset (eg, map the integers to just the even integers)

  - The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity means the number f(x) gets closer and closer to as x gets larger (which may or may not exist)

  - The limit of f(x) as x approaches k is infinity. The function gets larger than any given number provided that x is close enough to k

So, we can say pi has infinite digits in the ""set is infinite"" sense of infinity, but we can't say pi equals its decimal expansion times infinity (or `10^infinity`) because infinity isn't a number in this case.

Of course, even 2/3 has infinite digits in its base-10 expansion (though they do repeat), so pi isn't really special here: the infinite decimal expansion applies to many other numbers",

Quoting the first random web link I found (https://www.fst.com/news-stories/magazine/renewable-energy/human-power-plant/)

> Humans are electrified in the truest sense of the word. With every step, muscle contraction and reaction in our cells, our bodies produce energy. At rest, the human body generates an average of 100 watts of output. During sports activities, it reaches 300 to 400 watts. That’s the equivalent of burning 2,000 calories a day. Or, from a different perspective, the energy used by an LED floodlight over a 24-hour period. The body itself uses a large share of the energy it produces: for thinking, for movement or for organs and cells. It even consumes energy at night. What’s left escapes into the environment as heat.

However, at least part of their math is bad:

`400 W = 400 J/s * 86400 s/day = 34560000 J/day * 1 kcal / 4184 J ~ 8260 cal/day`

It's possible they meant 100 watts of output while resting burns about 2000 cal/day, which is fairly accurate",

I mean, that's bad, but that's the problem you need to solve, not your coworkers whole life. You have a stake here because it's affecting you and your kids, but your stake is limited to stopping the stealing (and potentially getting reimbursement and having your coworker prosecuted, though that seems extreme). Trying to control someone else's entire life is not the answer.

Assuming they are only stealing food (and not money earmarked for food or something) and not reselling it, you could make the moral argument that, regardless of circumstances, anyone who steals food should be pitied not judged. He Gets Us.",

I'm not convinced having a long marriage means the participants are happy. Monogamy seems unnatural, and I think group ""marriages"" (thruples, etc) are likely to become the norm because they make people happier and freer.

However, I'm not sure you're saying getting rid of marriage is a bad idea (I disagree) or that getting rid of marriage has led to people discussing male-female issues publicly and that the public discussion is the bad part (I also disagree).",

Tattoos, however, are a choice. And certain tattoos look better on certain people. So I agree you shouldn't say ""that tattoo is too feminine for you, a man"", but it's perfectly OK to say ""that tattoo doesn't seem to fit your overall personality (or body type or whatever)"". In other words, the aesthetic appeal of a tattoo depends both on what is being depicted and how and where it is being depicted.

I do agree that men and women might find happier relationships if they don't focus on ""traditional"" or gender-based roles. However, those biases sometimes run pretty deep and are hard to ignore.",

Quoting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria#History

> Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of vampire and werewolf legends, based upon certain perceived similarities between the condition and the folklore.

> In January 1964, L. Illis's 1963 paper 'On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves' was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine. Later, Nancy Garden argued for a connection between porphyria and the vampire belief in her 1973 book Vampires. In 1985, biochemist David Dolphin's paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 'Porphyria, Vampires, and Werewolves: The Aetiology of European Metamorphosis Legends', gained widespread media coverage, popularizing the idea.[citation needed]

> I've worked with a lot of students from Asia and found them to be infinitely more respectful and polite than their western counterparts

Asian culture is different from Western culture in many ways, so you can't attribute this difference to just corporal punishment.

Kids generally NEED to rebel to some degree to grow, and excessive respect and politeness towards adults can lead to covering up abuse: kids still need to speak out against bad parents and bad teachers.

> a child is being a little shit

This sounds like you're extremely angry at children and not like you're making a valid argument. I'm not sure why you chose to phrase it this way.

> teachers are unable to do their jobs because of the awful behaviour of young people.

I believe public education is really a form of imprisonment for students where they're forcefed useless or inaccurate knowledge and propoganda, and that teachers are mostly bad people who harm children. So teachers not doing their ""jobs"" is a good thing. At the same time, I do believe parents have the right to raise their children how they want, and thus the right to send their children to public school, but I can also understand why children rebel against public education.

> what they think the alternatives to physical discipline are?

This is the weakest part of your argument. Not even our prison system uses physical discipline. Non-violent restraint (forcing a child to remain in a room or an area and not use any entertainment devices) is a good alternative to corporal punishment. Because non-violent restraint may require some physical actions (such as picking the child up or barring a door), it's still a form of ""physical discipline"" but not the same thing as ""corporal punishment"".

To me, the only valid argument for corporal punishment is to remind kids that violence really is the ultimate answer. For the most part, we don't solve problems like slavery or genocide by putting people on the naughty step. Ultimately, we do need war and physical violence and no one should say ""violence is never the answer"". However, violence should be a last resort, and, despite what you say, it sounds like you want to use it a lot, not just in a few specific cases. But, ultimately, kids need to learn that, if they continue to disregard people's rights, they will be met with violence.",

Charities exist as does insurance. The problem is you want to force people to help him at their own expense: you must learn medicine and perform it regardless of what you want to do with your life.

Yes, in the sense I believe roads should be privatized (with some precautions). The government should provide minimal services and allow free enterprise to provide the rest.

I actually believe public education is the CAUSE of stupidity, not the cure. Keep in mind that ending public education means people get that money back: it doesn't just go away. So people can use that money to create or pay for private schools that teach the values they want, not some government imposed ""truths"".

Yes, and my point is less socialism = more freedom. And since US has the least socialism, we are the freest.",

Sure, but it might be false insight. Our theories are based on observations, and, the fewer the observations, the less valid the insight. Physics and chemistry are hard sciences and pretty solid. But when it comes to things like medicine, sociology, and other soft sciences, not so much

No, you're cherrypicking and showing nonrepresentative examples that suggest global warming is occurring when it's not. You asked a biased question that assumed global warming was occurring and then asked people for examples. You didn't request a balanced view and therefore didn't get one.

> scientists have been measuring and studying climates around the globe for decades and have been noticing measurable differences in climate activity and temperature and that regardless of this data gathering that you don’t “believe in” (and then claiming that you will only pay attention to empirical evidence, which obviously you do not)

I don't believe any of this is true. Show me what statistically valid empirical evidence we have of global warming. I do believe most applied statistics is done very poorly, and thus believe the small amount of nonrepresentative (deceptive) information that does exist proves nothing.",

You could argue it makes sociology less accurate, but I'll go further and say many sociological experiments are so poorly done that the results are meaningless.

Science requires theories based on observations, and, if you don't have good observations, you can't create a scientific theory. So, in that sense, yes, sociology is unscientific.

> The most common type of cemetery plot is the single plot, designed to accommodate one full-body burial. These plots typically measure around 3 feet wide by 8 feet long, with a depth ranging from 4 to 6 feet. This size allows for a single casket to be placed in the ground, ensuring a dignified and respectful final resting place for your loved one.

The math: `3 ft * 8 ft * 3 million/year = 72 million sqft * (1mi/5280ft)^2 ~ 2.58 sq mi per year`

So, even if everyone got buried in a single plot, we'd be burning 2.58 square miles per year. By way of comparison, the city of Denver (excluding suburbs) is 153 square miles, so it would take about 60 years to fill just Denver with stiffs. So we should probably start now.",

If you mean their own children, it's a form of discipline. Presumably, the child will now associate the bad action with a negative result and perform the bad action less frequently. It's the same general principle as corporal punishment, but less violent.

I agree it's not the best method of discipline, but it's convenient and fast (just like corporal punishment can be)

A Call for Global Collaboration Through Science and Logic

There are billions of people on this planet, spread across 195 countries. Many of us share a logical, curious mindset—wondering how the universe works and united by scientific thinking. Yet, we remain divided by borders, religions, and countless other artificial constructs.

It’s strange, isn’t it? Instead of competing to dominate, why don’t nations collaborate and grow together? Sadly, we can’t change the current system overnight, but what if we created a society governed by facts, logic, science, and philosophy? Imagine gathering visionary thinkers—people who prioritize progress over division—free from the arbitrary rules that separate us.

Think about the internet: when anonymous, we connect through ideas, not labels. Someone you dislike in person might inspire you online because their thoughts transcend superficial divisions. If we united curious minds in a shared space to exchange ideas, we could accelerate technological and societal advancement.

However, there’s a challenge. In most cases (not all), mixing staunch theists and atheists could reignite divisions. Many theists would form religious factions, and tensions with atheists might arise. This isn’t universal, but it’s a recurring pattern we can’t ignore.

Of course, collaboration involves more hurdles—funding, living conditions, and aligning diverse intelligences. This is just the core of my thoughts, but the vision is clear: a world where progress triumphs over pointless division.",

If you value your life at `x`, the expected value of eating n grapes is `((1000-n)/1000)*n*50000 - x*(n/1000)` which is 0 when `n = 1000 - x/50000`. However, this is a very lopsided answer because, even if you value your life at $1 million, you'd eat 980 grapes, virtually guaranteeing death. You might get a better answer if you consider the utility of money as not being linear: ie, 50M is not worth twice as much as 25M because you can live comfortably on either amount.

As a note, if you survive after eating n grapes, you might now consider the remaining grapes as a new game. However, if x remains the same, the expected value of the new game is only 0 when n is 0, meaning you wouldn't eat any grapes in the new game (it would be paradoxical if this weren't true).",

However, this is just a brief reply: I'd like to take a deeper look at your sources and answer further. The problem with both of our answers is that we're not listing scientific studies, but rather summaries or interpretations of scientific studies or even ""systematic review"" studies which just summarize other papers.

My claim is that if we look at the original studies themselves, we'll find they're deeply flawed, and that any review, summary or interpretation of these studies is also flawed.

> Specific studies are hard to find because this is psychology and it's immoral incorrect to broadcast experiments on kids

This is a big issue with ""social"" studies and other studies where it is unethical or impossible to obtain good data. People seem to believe that incomplete and inaccurate data is better than no data at all, but I feel the opposite. If you have no data, you can't reach any data-based conclusions. If you have bad data, you can reach bad (inaccurate) conclusions which is worse.

> but we know the effects it has through general medicine and behavioral patterns.  

I'm not sure I agree with this, but I'm also not sure what it means. It seems like another way of saying ""we don't have good data, but we're probably right anyway"". However, if it has an actual logical/mathematical meaning, I'd like to know what it is",

It's usually not a big deal because we generally know what S is, but it becomes an issue for questions like yours.

The statement ""there exists x such that `x^2 = -1`"" is technically ambiguous.

Instead, you should say ""x in R"" (no such x exists) or ""x in C"" (such an x does exist).

If assuming that x with a given property P exists in a given set S leads to a contradiction, you have a proof by contradiction that no x with property P exists in S. So you can say ""not (there exists in S such that P(x))"" or, equivalently, ""for all x in S, not P(x)"".

So, as others note, you don't have to assume there exists an x (in a given set) with the property you want, because you might end up proving all x in that set don't have that property.",

Agreed. I was actually thinking of the opposite problem: suppose we make an effort to boost short mens' esteem and it goes overboard to the point where they (we) become arrogant or even to the point where society prefers short men to taller men.

Unnecessary offensive paragraph: We sort of did this with teachers in the 80s when they wanted more money. Instead of paying them more, we created several ""teachers are wonderful intelligent people who deserve to be treated like saints"" campaign, and I think we went too far. It's not fair to say ""those who can, do: those who can't, teach"" (too far the other direction), but most teachers are less competent in their fields than professionals in those fields.

As a note, many US power companies measure electrictiy usage in kilowatt hours (kwh) which is 3.6 million joules.

> So the final unit is [...]

Watts, joules, and Newtons are all derived SI units. Going ""backwards"" from your computation:

  - newton is a force and thus mass times acceleration and thus `kg*m*s^-2` (using negative exponents here to avoid the ambiguity of things like `s/m/m` which you cancel as to `s` but could also be treated as `s/(m^2)`.

  - joule is work or force (newton) applied over a distance and thus `kg*m^2*s^-2`

  - watt is power or work applied over time and thus `kg*m^2*s^-3` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt confirms this)

  - a watt per second would thus be `kg*m^2*s^-4`, although I can't immediately think of a physical meaning to this term.

I therefore believe your calculations were incorrect.",
