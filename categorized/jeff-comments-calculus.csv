Many people find those problems easier than those with just variables (in the math sense of the word). If it helps, convert the constants to variables and solve that way

If that doesn't help, I'm guessing you're working off an equation (since you gave an `R` value with no formula), so we'd at least need to see the formula, though I'm guessing standard exponential decay.

Finally, remember that Celsius is a graded unit and you should convert to Kelvins",

For your special cases:

  - functions are non-differentiable at sharp corners: the derivative is undefined

  - for vertical asymptotes the slope is either increasing to infinity or decreasing to negative infinity

  - for horizontal asymptotes, the slope is flattening out to 0

  - if you're doing diaganol and other line-based asymptotes, the slope eventually is the same slope as the line itself",

Otherwise, substitution can sometimes help. Also, all trig functions can be written in terms of sine and cosine and these are each other's derivatives (to plus/minus factor), so you can always compute derivatives, which can help in seeing integrals",
