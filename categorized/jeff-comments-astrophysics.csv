Your post will doubtless be deleted, but ""the universe"" includes everything including us as observers. How could we be 13.8 billion light years away from where it started if we are part of that start.

I skimmed one of your papers and there's a lot of math in it, but I don't know enough physics to critique the math. I know `0^0 = 1` isn't mathematically valid (`0^0` is undefined), but it might be consistent in the way you're using it.",

I meant to say I accept geocentrism as being equally valid as heliocentrism, so I believe both. I could pretend our solar system is barycentric and get away on a technicality, but that's surprisingly not true until you get much further from our solar system",

I believe in geocentrism too, or even topocentrism since motion is relative. I do believe the Sun and Moon are different sizes, but your friend takes a whimsically direct view of the universe. Instead of convincing him, ask him to explain all planetary and stellar motion in terms of his worldview. Who know, he might find an almost consistent system",
