I believe that smoking (cigarettes or marijuna) is dangerous except to people who are non-COPD suspectible, but I'm saying you can't mathematically show that ""someone who never smokes is less likely to develop lung cancer than someone who does smoke"".

What you might be able to say if statistics bear it out: if we count all the people who are currently living and who have ever died (maybe put some sort of limit on it), group them into smokers and nonsmokers (not trivial, since smoking 1 cigarette 1 time doesn't make you a smoker), we will see a greater percentage of smokers have lung cancer than nonsmokers.

Of course, because correlation isn't causation, this doesn't mean smoking causes lung cancer, but it doesn't mean the opposite either.

Additionally, by drawing an arbitrary line between ""smoker"" and ""nonsmoker"", we ignore how much someone smokes, what they smoke, when in life they smoke, their overall general health, and so on. If we attempt to determine someone's chance of developing lung cancer from these data, we are assuming all smokers have the same chance of developing lung cancer, which can't possibly be true.

My argument is more ""don't abuse mathematics"" than ""smoking is safe""",

Personally, I think plenty of people are and can be in healthy long-term monogamous relationships. In fact, I'd argue the majority of people are looking for this type of relationship

However, there's no need to attack polygamy/polyamory. The whole point of tolerance is to say ""what I want to do is OK and what you want to do is OK"". T

> I’m not sure if I believe polyamory is possible as most groups I’ve seen are people with too much self esteem and others who look like they have given up

This sounds like confirmation bias: you want to see polyamorous people as unhappy so you do. It's also possible you've met too few polyamorous people and are judging all of them based on a small number.

You sound angry at polyamorists because you think they're ""stealing"" available partners from you and shrinking the dating pool for monogamous relationships. They're not. If anything, polyamorists would be unhappy in a monogamous relationship and probably not be ""faithful"". It's actually better that they live their lifestyle their way instead of being forced into yours.

That's not really a lot. It's less than 1/5th. For a truly universal language, we'd want it ideally at 100%, but at least at 90%

> around 1.1 Billion of the world's population learned english as their 2nd language and only around 200million for mandarin

That's not really relevant. It doesn't matter if someone knows a language natively or non-natively. If 95% of the world spoke the same language natively, that would become the de facto world language. Additionally, people have a stake in making their native language the universal one since it means they don't have to learn a second language.

> Aint no way that much people is learning english if its not the universal language

That just means a lot of people are convinced English is a good 2nd language to have, or even that a lot of people are convinced English is or will be the universal language. However, that doesn't mean it actually is

> So you tellin me if we were to create a universal language, it shouldnt be the most spoken???

Zeno rationally showed that motion is impossible (at least, that's one variant of the paradox) and posted that on the Internet (ie, he told other philosophers about it).

Zeno wasn't an idiot: he knew motion was possible. He was showing that, though pure reasoning (that was accepted at the time) you could come up with ridiculous conclusions. He was ""mocking"" ""pure math"" by showing it's contradicts real life.

Russell and others have done the same. It's taken us a long time to find an axiom system that appears to be contradiction-free. However, Godel has shown that we can't rule out the possibility a contradiction exists.

If Terence Howard can create an argument that makes rational (or even physical) sense, then he might be showing our current axiom system is flawed.

Realistically, however, I don't think Howard used axiomatic proof methods, so his error lies elsewhere. His claim isn't ""1*1 = 2"" is common sense. Rather, his claim is that ""using common sense, I can show 1*1 = 2; therefore something is wrong with math"".",

I still believe that physical punishments MAY be valid, and that children should learn this early on. Ultimately, we fight wars with weapons, not hugs. We approach violent criminals with guns, not therapy.

So I guess the answer to the OP's question would be ""because they thought it would help their children become better people [the Bible explicitly states 'spare the rod, spoil the child' and many Americans are Christian], but, depending on how you define 'better people', this may've worked for some children and not for others. Overall, both crime and corporal punishment have decreased over the years, so, if you define 'better people' as 'committing fewer crimes', the theory has failed at that higher level"".

""HOWEVER, some parents would argue that people becoming less religious, protesting the government more, and using recreational substances more, while not always illegal, make them 'bad people', so, in their eyes, and assuming they believe corporally-punished children engage less in these activities, they were correct""",

The strongest ""evidence"" for flat Earth is that there was a time, perhaps before recorded history, that most people believed the Earth was flat, and they had gravity, lunar eclipses and ""changing of the constellations"" (via the ""celestial sphere"")

If a dome is flat, then any hemisphere of the Earth really IS flat, and there's a hemisphere that's almost all water-- maybe the opposite of that hemisphere is our domed Earth and all that water just lies in a trough or something.

The time to reach `27.78 m/s` is `27.78/a` seconds (where `a` is in `m/s^2`). So, after `27.78/a` seconds, the car is at `100km/h` and has traveled `a(27.78/a)^2/2 = 385.86/a`.

The moment you choose to look at speed (instead of any of the literally trillions of other factors involved in driving in a given place by a given person at a given time), you have introduced bias. You're not going to find a correlation between, say, wind speed and accidents if you don't look at wind speeds.

I'm claiming that a great deal of statistical ""research"" is founded on this kind of bias: the desire to demonize or angelify a group of people or activities leads to the factor you study.

Statistical research is only valid if you consider all factors, which would lead to no conclusions (ie, when done properly, statistics is often useless)

> run diract studies were you limit speed in an area where in 2 similar places you change the speed limit in one and not the other and compare death and accidents. all of these steps prove that speed kills

Ignoring the bias I mention above and the fact that past performance doesn't imply future performance, this would actually be a valid scientific experiment, provided you chose 1000s of locations and randomly decided where to increase or decrease the speed limit.

There's definitely an ethical issue here, but the other issue is compliance. Changing the speed limit won't necessarily change the actual speed people are driving. However, if the goal is to determine what speed LIMIT is safest (perhaps none at all), this would at least be a valid experiment. Can you show anyone has conducted such an experiment?",

1. If we looked at all drives for all people worldwide over a non-cherrypicked period of time, and looked at:

  - %age of people driving over posted speed limit who got into an accident

  - %age of people driving at or below posted speed limit who got into an accident

are you claiming the first number would be higher? If so, what valid statistical studies do you have to demonstrate this belief. I take a neutral stance saying there isn't enough good information to decide.

Our second argument: even if we could show that speed is IN GENERAL more dangerous, could we use it to morally or statistically justify speed limits and the answer is no for the same reason we can't justify things like racial profiling.

While we're not scared of all other dangerous animals, we are scared of big cats such as lions and tigers, wolves, and, unless you're a woman taking an online poll, bears.

They also primarily blame India and China.

Reprisal from other ""climate scientists"", of course

I believe the methodology used to count studies (or people) who support climate change is itself flawed. For example, searching for ""global warming"" will miss papers that mention ""global cooling"", ""nuclear winter"", ""long term global temperature trends"", etc.

See if you can find a study (on either global warming or the consensus), read the methodology section, and, if you feel the methodology is sufficient to show the conclusion, please link it.

Alternatively, propose a methodology for either and show that someone has experimented using that methodology

Also, I'm trying to remain polite. Please do so as well.",

I believe neighborhoods should at least consider being privatized so they contain no public land.

Keep in mind charities exist, and they're the ones who should be showing compassion. The government shouldn't control my compassion

I'm arguing they should be taxed even less: an equal dollar amount. Even with lower tax rates for the rich, they are seriously overpaying.

> A 2014 National Crime Victimization Study found that nearly a quarter (24%) of all domestic violence victims were men, while DomesticShelters.org cites that less than 15% of abuse victims are men. This lack of consistency could be due to differing definitions of what constitutes domestic violence and using different parameters to collect and categorize the data.

However, 15% is still high.

> The National Domestic Violence Hotline, for example, reports that 1 in 10 men aged 18 and older in the US experience rape, physical violence, and/or stalking. They then also break it down to 1 in 7 men who experience severe physical violence by an intimate partner alone, versus 1 in 19 men who experience stalking, and 1 in 71 who experience rape

The 1 in 10 and 1 in 7 numbers are inconsistent, so I have to assume the 1 in 7 means ""of the 1 in 10, 1 in 7 of those"" which brings it down to 1 in 70.

> Multiple sources conclude that psychological aggression is the most common form of abuse experienced by men

This is problematic. While I don't support psychological aggression, I see it as less of a problem than physical assault and battery. I realize psychological aggression can include threats of violence (assault), I think actual physical violence is more of a concern.

> DomesticShelters.org reports that 26% of gay men and 37% of bisexual men, or 2 in 5 gay or bisexual men overall, experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime.

This at least suggests those instigating violence are male. That doesn't contradict your point that men are victims, but does suggest that most or many abusers are males.

As you said yourself:

> Obviously women are still at much higher risk for the worst outcomes such as murder which is important. But male victims are definitely not the tiny fringe exceptions to the rule that they are commonly portrayed as.

So the question would be: weighting for severity, how much more violence is directed towards women than men.

Another major issue is defining assault and violence: statistics are helpful, but, at some point, we need to know what actually happened and have an independent party decide whether it constitutes assault",

I admit I'm shocked, though, if you're forced to think about it logically, there a LOT of schools in the USA, blah blah, blah.

Plowing on with statistics, the data on https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/school-enrollment/2022-cps.html (the ""All Races"" spreadsheet) there are 75 million children enrolled in school in the United States.

It's hard to estimate the number of CEOs in the United States, since you could argue that, in a one-person business, the one person is technically also the CEO. Assuming we mean large company CEOs, https://ceoworld.biz/2024/01/13/the-worlds-most-influential-ceos-and-business-executives-of-2024/ says they compiled data on ""almost 3,000 CEOs from all over the world"", which, because I'm getting bored, we will say are all the large business CEOs in the world. The US has less than 5% of the world's population, but it's unlikely CEOs are distributed evenly around the globe, so let's say 25% of 750 in USA.

Now, continuing with this garbage calculation, there are 100,000 as many kids as CEOs. Assuming 327 shootings led to about 1000 deaths, we can expect about 0.01 CEO deaths per year.

If you're too ""lazy"" to do this yourself, you can google around and probably find articles that compare how unhealthy food is based on various factors, and hopefully provide the raw data/research that reaches that conclusion. However, you're unlikely to find 100% agreement.

> ""Cook more to save money, be healthy, and maybe even have fun and learn a new skill"" is good advice for most people.

True, but the person who said that later said they didn't enjoy cooking, which turns one positive into a negative. I was just saying that, if you don't like cooking, the health and monetary benefits are, *for most people*, *in my opinion*, not worth it. Of course, that's situational. If you're poor or on a heavily restricted diet, cooking ""under duress"" may still have net benefit.

Fast food tastes awesome, so, yes, not eating it could be considered suffering. I hate actuaries and statistics, and do not accept your belief that fast food necessarily leads to suffering in later life.

> maximize long-term enjoyment

Disagree, call dead guy philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) to the stand. Felicific calculus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus) suggests long-term enjoyment should be just one factor in decision making. Other types of pleasure must be considered too.

You're probably seeing observation bias combined, especially since you believe anyone who supports billionaires is a form of ""predictable pandering to corporations from any large media companies"". In other words, you're saying ""most people agree with me (false because Reddit is left leaning) and everyone who doesn't is fake (also false)"".

  - ""getting drunk"": Clarify if you mean any social drinking or a specific level of ""drunkeness"". Accusing people who drink socially of being ""drunk"" could be offensive. Try ""am not interested in alcohol or drugs"" or something.

  - ""hooking up with strangers"": There's a difference between having casual sex with acquaintences and ""strangers"". Perhaps just say you're not interested in casual sex

  - ""sex with random people"": again a bit offensive (and mathematically incorrect, though that's probably not an issue); you can again just say ""casual sex""

  - ""slept around"": a very negative way of saying ""enjoys recreational sex with a variety of partners""

  - ""find out the other person was promiscuous"": this implies you get into a relationship without asking about someone's sexual history and then leave them if you find out they've slept with a lot of people. Maybe find that out first

""I'm not into clubbing, drugs and alcohol and casual sex. Is it morally acceptable for me to seek a partner with similar values?""

You don't have to use those words exactly, of course, but avoid the implication that people who don't meet your personal standard are inferior as human beings vs just being potentially poor partners for you.

From a practical standpoint, having a partner with the same values as you is a good thing, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if they previously had different values, especially if you are both young. People can change quite a bit while growing up",

Another argument is that weight loss is difficult and stressful and most people who try to lose weight fail. Putting yourself through all that stress for no result is unhealthy. Therefore, remaining heavy could actually be healthier than trying to lose weight.

My argument (not commonly accepted) is that there's no actual evidence that weight loss increases health, and, if you include things like mental health, even successful weight loss could decrease health.

EDIT: Looking over https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/labeling-and-warning-statements-tobacco-products/cigarette-labeling-and-health-warning-requirements I believe most of these warnings are deceptive because they use the words ""cause"" deceptively, since not everyone who smokes will have these issues. ""Can hypothetically cause"" or ""may cause"" would be more accurate, but is still extremely biased.

I'm opposed to compulsory speech, and believe that consumers should understand the risks of using any product they consume.

I'd like to see tobocco companies (and this might even be legal) explain the processes by which the Surgeon General makes these determinations and point out the serious logical and statistical flaws in these studies, as well as deliberately deceptive studies and statements. Similarly, I'd like to see benefits of smoking (such as weight loss and the potentially destressing properties of nicotine), though I do realize the benefits are usually not worth the risks.

I'd also like tobocco companies point out there are plenty of other risks that may lead to the specified diseases/dangers to avoid making it seem like smoking is the only issue.

The fundamental problem with most studies involving people is that they assume past performance implies future performance (time extrapolation) which isn't necessarily true, and that correlation implies causation.",

However, since you said annual percentage YIELD, that means you get 3.90% total per year. If that amount is compounded monthly, you get a rate `r` per month where `(1+r)^12 = 1+3.90%` yielding `r = 0.319331%` or a monthly payment of `$566.80 * 0.319331% = $1.81` for the first month. Of course, the next month you'll have `$566.80 + $1.81 = $568.61` in your account and get the same `0.319331%` on that so it'll be a slightly larger amount.

That's an interesting interpretation of the definition of property, but I'm not sure everyone would agree with it:

  - If you accept anti-drug and anti-prostitution laws, you already agree that the government can limit what you can do with your own body

  - Even if you're libertarian, you accept that people can't hit each other, which again limits your use of your property when it harms another. In the case of abortion, harm to another is obvious

  - The government can't seize property without ""just compensation"", implying they CAN seize it with proper compensation. While the government isn't paying women to not get abortions, the general principle applies: we don't really own our own property

Of course, the Supreme Court has made some very strange interpretations of the Constitution. Ultimately, their opinion is the one that counts

I'm making up the numbers below, but the point still holds:

  - We find that 70% of people who use hard drugs had used marijuana prior to using hard drugs

  - Some people read this as '70% of people who try marijuana end up using hard drugs', but that's not what that means

  - We later find that about 80% of the population has used marijuana at some point in their life

  - Based purely on statistics, we could now say that using marijuana means it's LESS likely that you'll use hard drugs, but this is a historical statement that may not hold in the future

You could therefore conclude that making marijuana usage mandatory would lessen the hard drug problem, but this is also bad statistics.

No one, not even people who use marijuana, really wants to argue that marijuana should be mandatory, so you didn't hear the argument above that often.

Reasoning is using known data to arrive at provably correct conclusions. The standard example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Reasoning like that comes from logic and is the realm of pure mathematics.

Another example: if you spin a fair 6-sided die 666666 times, it will come up ""4"" *approximately* 111111 times, but more likely a range around that number than the number exactly. Problem: there are no fair die in the real world: it's probably impossible to create one. Therefore, when people make scientific calculations about dice in the real word, the ""scientific reasoning"" assumptions is that the dice are fair.

Other assumptions science makes that aren't pure reasoning:

  - Scientific theories are likely to continue working. When Newton came up with the Laws of Motion, he never realized they were only approximately true and subject to the laws of Special Relativity that Einstein would discover later. Someone said the half-life of a scientific fact is about 7 years (don't know how, but Stephen Fry quoted them on QI), meaning about half of what we know today will be shown false within 7 years. While whoever said it was speaking very generally, if we take it literally, it means over 99.9% of what we know will be false in 70 years. Even if we don't take it literally, the idea that science is truth is bad reasoning. It's more accurate to say science is truth based on what we now, but probably not absolute truth

  - Scientific theories are the same over space and time for the most part. For example, we believe the Andromeda Galaxy is similar to ours, has stars that are mostly balls of plasma comprised of hydrogen spewing out hydrogen. And we're probably right. However, Andromeda is very far away and, assuming you accept the speed of light is fixec (another assumption) we're looking at it 2.5 million years ago. To reason that Andromeda is similar to our own galaxy, we must accept that stars work the same far away and a long time ago. That's not something we can prove: it's just something science assumes

  - No greater intelligence created what we see. Scientists can explain how the galaxy and stars and planets and moons were formed based on how they look now and figuring out what could've led to them being this way. Of course, it's possible some sort of God creature just created all these things and then vanished. Science automatically discards the possibility of a greater intelligence and strives to explain things assuming no such intelligence. Again, that's something you can't get through pure reasoning. Another way to say this: scientists like to minimize the amount of ""magic"" required for things to happen.

Data can't show this because future ""likelihood"" can't be measured. You could only say that, historically, immigrants over a given period of time have been convincted of more crimes per capita than people born in the United States.

I actually thought the opposite was true (immigrants commit fewer crimes per capita), so I'd like a source, but let's continue assuming the paragraph above is true.

The data you're presenting is inherently biased because you're only using immigration status to determine crime per capita. You do sort of correct for this by mentioning socioeconomic status, but that's not enough. Statistically, the only fair way to judge someone is to consider EVERY subset they're a member of. There are Bell number ways to partition a set, and I'm claiming that, mathematically, you must consider all of them, which, because of symmetry, will tell you nothing.

You're also assuming past performance implies future performance, which is statistically invalid.

As a general question, what do you plan to do about other groups of people whose crime rate per capita has been higher than other groups? For example poor people (people of lower socioeconomic status) who were born in the USA?

> we should instead be more strict, and slow down immigration

As above, the data doesn't show that at all. The data doesn't (and can't) show that immigrants may not greatly improve our country, especially since there are different kinds of immigrants. Not all immigrants are equally likely to commit crimes.

So, even if you ignore moral and ethical issues (I, personally, support open borders), data does not give us the ""right answer"".",

I don't believe we can accurately measure average global surface temperature at all (at least until recently), so I view these conclusions as inherently meaningless.

I know some organizations claim to have measured average global surface temperature, but these methods are based on non-randomly-sampled point data and are statistically unsound

Yup, that's exactly what I think. If you look at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/1925/ (which I realize isn't the only source of 1925 weather data), you'll see 7 stations listed. How are you going to get average surface temperature from that?

As a statistician (I claim no credentials, I just like the way the word sounds), I believe there is insufficient evidence to show the globe is warming, to show the globe is cooling, and even that the globe is remaining at the same temperature. This sounds like a contradiction but it works in statistics: sometimes the data isn't sufficient to reach any conclusion.

> The most common type of cemetery plot is the single plot, designed to accommodate one full-body burial. These plots typically measure around 3 feet wide by 8 feet long, with a depth ranging from 4 to 6 feet. This size allows for a single casket to be placed in the ground, ensuring a dignified and respectful final resting place for your loved one.

The math: `3 ft * 8 ft * 3 million/year = 72 million sqft * (1mi/5280ft)^2 ~ 2.58 sq mi per year`

So, even if everyone got buried in a single plot, we'd be burning 2.58 square miles per year. By way of comparison, the city of Denver (excluding suburbs) is 153 square miles, so it would take about 60 years to fill just Denver with stiffs. So we should probably start now.",

However, this is just a brief reply: I'd like to take a deeper look at your sources and answer further. The problem with both of our answers is that we're not listing scientific studies, but rather summaries or interpretations of scientific studies or even ""systematic review"" studies which just summarize other papers.

My claim is that if we look at the original studies themselves, we'll find they're deeply flawed, and that any review, summary or interpretation of these studies is also flawed.

> Specific studies are hard to find because this is psychology and it's immoral incorrect to broadcast experiments on kids

This is a big issue with ""social"" studies and other studies where it is unethical or impossible to obtain good data. People seem to believe that incomplete and inaccurate data is better than no data at all, but I feel the opposite. If you have no data, you can't reach any data-based conclusions. If you have bad data, you can reach bad (inaccurate) conclusions which is worse.

> but we know the effects it has through general medicine and behavioral patterns.  

I'm not sure I agree with this, but I'm also not sure what it means. It seems like another way of saying ""we don't have good data, but we're probably right anyway"". However, if it has an actual logical/mathematical meaning, I'd like to know what it is",

Agreed. I was actually thinking of the opposite problem: suppose we make an effort to boost short mens' esteem and it goes overboard to the point where they (we) become arrogant or even to the point where society prefers short men to taller men.

Unnecessary offensive paragraph: We sort of did this with teachers in the 80s when they wanted more money. Instead of paying them more, we created several ""teachers are wonderful intelligent people who deserve to be treated like saints"" campaign, and I think we went too far. It's not fair to say ""those who can, do: those who can't, teach"" (too far the other direction), but most teachers are less competent in their fields than professionals in those fields. Ironically, by convincing people (and teachers themselves) that teachers are great has just led to more calls for paying teachers more.",
