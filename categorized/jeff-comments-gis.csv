You can go to worldpop.org to get the nld_ppp_2020_UNadj_constrained.tif file mentioned in the code.

Roughly speaking, the code converts all the populated (non-0, non-NA) points in the TIF to the unit sphere in 3D, creates a KDTree of them, queries a given point with a given radius, and adds the population of all points found.

Since I'm using the unit sphere and 3D, you have to convert stuff before querying. Obviously, a more polished version would use functions to do this. The code:

```
using ArchGDAL
using Plots

# TODO: generalize this to read large TIF files directly from disk

# read all data into an array

dataset = ArchGDAL.read(""nld_ppp_2020_UNadj_constrained.tif"")
band = ArchGDAL.getband(dataset, 1)
array = ArchGDAL.read(band)
height = ArchGDAL.height(dataset)
width = ArchGDAL.width(dataset)

# find only points with Dutch people

# NOTE: there are 1512630 such points out of height*width = 15849120
# total points, so big savings here (nearly 90% decrease)

dutchpts = findall(i -> i>0, array)

# note these are parallel arrays; they are NOT Cartesian producted together

lngs = [gt[1] + (i[1]-0.5)*gt[2] for i in dutchpts]
lats = [gt[4] + (i[2]-0.5)*gt[6] for i in dutchpts]

# determine x y z in 3D (TODO: double calc of sin(lat) is inefficient)

xs = cosd.(lats) .* cosd.(lngs)
ys = cosd.(lats) .* sind.(lngs)
zs = sind.(lats)

# uncomment this line to see what the points look like 

# scatter3d(xs, ys, zs, markersize = 0.1)

treepts = transpose(hcat(xs, ys, zs))

tree = KDTree(treepts)

# sample query point (Amsterdam)

queryLat = 52.366668723027
queryLng = 4.88333731194361

# convert to x y z

queryPt = [cosd(queryLat)*cosd(queryLng), cosd(queryLat)*sind(queryLng), sind(queryLat)]

# convert 5km to xyz distance, assuming 6371.009 earth radius

queryDist = asin(5/6371.009)
