In a nuclear reaction, `E = mc^2`, so if mass doesn't change, the amount of energy released is independent of what is reacting.

A more interesting question that I couldn't find an answer to: if we could digest iron by oxidizing it (which would be weird because our blood has iron in it), what would the exothermic heat (enthalpy energy) released by the reaction. Also, what is enthalpy and what does exothermic mean?",

As you note, however, things like nation of birth, year of birth, religious affiliation, etc, split people into more than 2 subsets, and we can't assume an equal number of people were born each year or that an equal number of people are born in each nation.

The ""correct"" way to do this is to take the probability of being born in country X, square it, and then add across all countries. Same for year of birth, etc. It would be interesting to do this to see how many factors it takes (and assuming independence which might be an issue) before we can be fairly confident no two people share the same values",

Of course, you may end up with combinations of these factors that no one has previously had (or too few people have had to make valid estimation), but let's ignore that for now.

Suppose I introduct a new metric: the sum of the number of letters in the first two states someone lived in (0 if a state is null). ""There's no way that metric has anything to do with life expectancy"" you might say. And you'd probably be right. However, if we keep looking, we might (in fact, must) find a metric that's better at predicting life expectancy than any of the ones you're using and any combinations of those.

Now, you have a problem: why are you deliberately ignoring an accurate correlation and choosing age, etc? That's because you believe, in a non-mathematically-provable sense, that those factors are more important.

I claim this is a defect in the English language, statistics in general, and the cause of most discrimination. I'm also worried that, when AI starts pumping out discriminatory statement, people will believe them because they think AI is unbiased.

To be mathematically accurate, you have to consider all possible partitions of your population into 1 or more subsets. You could make the weak argument that there's no way to do that, so you have to use only the data that's available (definition of availibility bias)

However, you can via symmetry. The number of partitions of n people is the Bell number of n. If you consier all of these partitions, by symmetry, everyone will have the same life expectancy.",

I think this similar to cutting the sphere surface into n similar pieces which I've been struggling with.

You can, of course, put n points on the equator (or any line of longitude or any other great circle) equidistantly, but I'm assuming no 3 points can be colinear? This corresponds to the ""orange slice"" model of splitting the sphere. Interesting, but not extensible to smaller slices",

Assuming you flatten both states down to sea level (which might not be the correct interpretation-- you might only want to flatten to Idaho's lowest point) and that my calculations below are correct [which someone should definitely double check], flat Idaho is slightly bigger than regular Texas, but smaller than flat Texas.

My methodology: Idaho has an area of 83570 square miles average elevaation of 4921 feet. If we started at sea level and elevated each square mile 4921 feet by placing it on a regular parallelpiped (box), that would require 4 sides of a square each 1 mile long and 4921 feet high, thus increasing the surface area by `4291 ft * 4 miles = ~3.25 miles^2` for every square mile. Of course, we'd still have the original square mile, just a lot higher now, so the new area would be `83570*4.25 = ~271666 square miles`.

Note that the calculation above works even if you use square feet or square meters or any unit of measure you want (the boxes will change size, but the additional added area will be the same). The calculation also works even though Idaho has a non-consistent elevation: a 3000 foot box and a 5000 foot box will add the same area as 2 4000 foot boxes.

Texas has an area of `~268600 mi^2`, which IS smaller, but it also has an average elevation of 1706 feet. Following the same calculations as above, ""flat Texas"" has an area of `~615745 mi^2`, about 127% bigger than flat Idaho",

Air has a density of `~1.293 kg/m^3` so the air mass is `203.88 m^3 * 1.293 kg/m^3 ~ 263.62 kg`. That seems heavy so I double checked: per the ideal gas law, 1 mole of gas takes up 22.4 L at STP, and `203.88 m^3 = 203880 L`, so that's approx 10000 mol and the molar mass of nitrogen is about 28g, so it works out.

The specific heat of air is `1.005 J/(g*K)` where K is in Kelvin. Since 50F to 70F is 10C to 21C, that's an 11 degree change in Kelvins, so `1.005 J/(g*K)*11K ~ 11.06 J/g`.

Thus it would require `11.06 J/g * 263.62kg ~ 2.916*10^6 J` of energy total, though only if the heater is 100% efficient (which it isn't since it also generates light) and we only heat the air not the walls, and there's no new cold air coming in or heat escaping, etc, etc, etc.

Space heaters run at pretty high wattage, say 1500W, so, under ideal circumstances, you could heat the room in `2.916*10^6 J/1500W ~ 1944 seconds` or around 32 minutes.

Note that, if you didn't want to look them up, you could get both the mass and specific heat of air using the Ideal Gas Law",

So, at 60 degrees north (where cosine is conveniently 1/2) it takes 2 degrees of longitude travel to match 1 degree of latitude travel. Mercator maps are conformal (angle preserving) so this ""2 degrees east, 1 degree north"" is going to look like a 45 degree line pointing northeast.",
