You could take the derivative and set equal to 0, but, since we're only looking for the minimum distance, we notice that this distance is minimal when its square is minimal, so we take derivative of `x^2 + p(x)^2` and set equal to 0 instead. 

The derivative is `2x + 2p(x)*p'(x)`. If `p(x)` has degree n, `p(x)*p'(x)` has degree `n + (n-1) = 2n-1`, so you have to solve a `2n-1` degree polynomial",

As an example, what are the chances you'll get just 1s, 3s, and 5s in the first 10 rolls followed by an even number?

Note there are `6^10` total ways to roll a die 10 times

There are `3^10` ways to roll a die 10 times with only odd numbers.

However, the count above includes cases where you only roll 1s and 3s, and don't roll any 5s, for example.

The ways you can roll only 1s and 3s is `2^10`. The ways you can roll only 1s and 5s is `2^10`, and the ways you can only roll 3s and 5s is `2^10`. We have to subtract these off so our running total is now `3^10 - 3*2^10`

When we removed ""only 1s and 5s"" and ""only 1s and 3s"", we removed ""only 1s"" twice, so we need to add it back in (just 1 way to get all 1s). Similarly for ""only 3s"" and ""only 5s"".

That brings our final total to `3^10 - 3*2^10 + 3 = 55980`. So there are `55980/6^10 = 1555/1679616` to roll all three odd numbers in 10 rolls, and we multiply that by 1/2 to make the 11th roll even to get a final answer (for 10 rolls) of `1555/3359232`

For n rolls followed by an even, we have `3^n` for only odd rolls, minus `3*2^n` for only odd rolls that only have two numbers plus 3 for single number odd rolls, or `3^n - 3*2^n + 3` total. The chances are therefore `(3^n - 3*2^n + 3)/6^n/2`, the final `/2` being for the even roll following

I cheated and used WolframAlpha (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Sum%5B%283%5En+-+3*2%5En+%2B+3%29%2F6%5En%2F2%2C+%7Bn%2C3%2C+Infinity%7D%5D) and this sum turns out to be 1/20.

Therefore, there is 1/20 chance of getting all 3 odd numbers before seeing an even number",

However, the log of the S&P is better approximated by a normal distribution plus `k*n` where k is constant. In other words, the log of the S&P is expected to increase over time, increasing the chance of an all-time high.

Of course, because interest rates themselves fluctuate, and because the log model has been show to be false (thus, the volatility smile when pricing options), even that model isn't super accurate.",

As an example for the first case, plotting `y` vs `1/x` gives us (with 1/x first then y, although linearity works in either direction) `(1, 3/12), (1/2, 3/16), (1/3, 3/20)`. If we take the slopes between the first two points, we get `(3/16-3/12)/(1/2-1) = 1/8` and between the last two points as `(3/20-3/16)/(1/3-1/2) = 9/40`. Since these slopes don't match, y versus 1/x is not the right answer

There is probably a faster way to do this, but sometimes brute force is the ""easiest"" (not fastest)

However, this is a very lopsided answer because, even if you value your life at $1 million, you'd eat 980 grapes, virtually guaranteeing death. You might get a better answer if you consider the utility of money as not being linear: ie, 50M is not worth twice as much as 25M because you can live comfortably on either amount.

As a note, if you survive after eating n grapes, you might now consider the remaining grapes as a new game. However, if x remains the same, the expected value of the new game is only 0 when n is 0, meaning you wouldn't eat any grapes in the new game (it would be paradoxical if this weren't true).",

It's usually not a big deal because we generally know what S is, but it becomes an issue for questions like yours.

The statement ""there exists x such that `x^2 = -1`"" is technically ambiguous.

Instead, you should say ""x in R"" (no such x exists) or ""x in C"" (such an x does exist).

If assuming that x with a given property P exists in a given set S leads to a contradiction, you have a proof by contradiction that no x with property P exists in S. So you can say ""not (there exists in S such that P(x))"" or, equivalently, ""for all x in S, not P(x)"".

So, as others note, you don't have to assume there exists an x (in a given set) with the property you want, because you might end up proving all x in that set don't have that property.",
