There are a lot of ways to change mtime without even opening the file. Some badly behaved backup programs will do this to see what files have changed since the last backup. In theory, a bad virus scanner could do this too. Of course, it's possible it's malicious, but mtime changes aren't inherently suspicious. I even stopped using mtime as a reliable indicator of when a file was created/changed because there are so many ways it can change without the file changing",
