While you're trying to be a good friend by ""teaching"" them how to drive safely, not everyone wants to learn from their friends: they view friends as equals, not authorities. He'll need to learn from someone he respects.

I don't object to people driving under the influence provided they can do so safely. Re reckless, we're just hearing your side of it. It sounds like the friend thinks he's driving safely, and hasn't had any accidents. And, even if he really is driving recklessly, it's probably going to take an accident to convince him.

Tattoos, however, are a choice. And certain tattoos look better on certain people. So I agree you shouldn't say ""that tattoo is too feminine for you, a man"", but it's perfectly OK to say ""that tattoo doesn't seem to fit your overall personality (or body type or whatever)"". In other words, the aesthetic appeal of a tattoo depends both on what is being depicted and how and where it is being depicted.
