So if you *don't* live in an icy or cold climate, you *shouldn't* tip?

> If the meal is expensive, you obviously have the money to tip.

The opposite is true. The more the meal costs, the less money I have for tipping. Remember, restaurants sometimes charge Doordash customers more, not to mention Doordash's own service and delivery fees. We're playing plenty already.

> If the meal is cheap, you saved enough to tip.

But then the meal isn't cheap any more :)

> If you're broke, don't use doordash.

I'm not broke. I can afford to pay for the food at a premium price, I can afford to pay Doordash's service fees, and even delivery fees (except I have Dashpass, but same thing). Maybe it's not a question of having the money, but just not wanting to tip.

> None of you responded to my previous post asking why you don't tip.

If you could point me to the post, I can answer there as well, but I think tipping culture is a bad idea and needs to stop.",
