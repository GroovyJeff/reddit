Well, not quite because of ""time dilation"": https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html

Of course, time for those who are non-accelerating will pass at a much faster rate.",

Maybe. Solar sails (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail) can reach high speeds and very large ones could theoretically carry people. Acceleration isn't an issue either. Even acclerating at normal Earth gravity (1g) you could travel the Milky Way in a single lifetime (https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html)

We could also send out a message (on a solar sail or just broadcasting) saying ""hey, we'd like to visit, but can't travel faster than light, send instructions on warp drive, k thanks"" or something

Generation ships could make sense if we find sentient life and communicate with it and they invite us over. Otherwise, I agree that randomly going to nearby stars probably won't be useful.",

In theory, the moon is only totally dark during a solar eclipse. At all other times, it reflects at least a little sunlight so is theoretically (thought not necessarily practically) visible as at least a crescent.

There is actaully one very pedantic exception to this (which is the basis of a disagreement I have with NASA), but, for the most part, the paragraph above is true.",
