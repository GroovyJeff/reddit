> The risk-free rate of return is the interest rate an investor can expect to earn on an investment that carries zero risk. In practice, the risk-free rate is commonly considered to be equal to the interest paid on a 10-year highly rated government Treasury note, generally the safest investment an investor can make.",

Watts, joules, and Newtons are all derived SI units. Going ""backwards"" from your computation:

  - newton is a force and thus mass times acceleration and thus `kg*m*s^-2` (using negative exponents here to avoid the ambiguity of things like `s/m/m` which you cancel as to `s` but could also be treated as `s/(m^2)`.

  - joule is work or force (newton) applied over a distance and thus `kg*m^2*s^-2`

  - watt is power or work applied over time and thus `kg*m^2*s^-3` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt confirms this)

  - a watt per second would thus be `kg*m^2*s^-4`, although I can't immediately think of a physical meaning to this term.

I therefore believe your calculations were incorrect.",
