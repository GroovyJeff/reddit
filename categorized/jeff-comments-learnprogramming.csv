It uses up 128 entries total, or 7 bits. If you use only these bytes, you are in ""ASCII mode"". If you use any characters outside of these, you are in ""binary mode"".

Even today, some languages, some programs and some operating systems distinguish between the two modes. Example: https://diveintopython.org/learn/file-handling/binary-files

In particular, some SMTP servers don't handle binary data well, so you have to encode (not encrypt) your message into ASCII. Base64 (aka MIME-64) is actually a pretty efficient system, using 8 bits to store 6 bits of data.

In some sense, this was inevitable. Programmers are essentially translators between humans and computers: you tell us what you want the computer to do and we convert it to the computer's language. Of course, one of you got smart and asked us to have the computer do the translation itself so you would no longer need us and we, not being terribly bright when it comes to things like that, did so.",
