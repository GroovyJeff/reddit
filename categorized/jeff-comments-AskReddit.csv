Hypothesis: if  a randomly selected overweight or obese person tries to lose weight, they will get healthier. Specifics:

  - We measure health on a numerical scale by self-assesement of health and happiness over the past 2 weeks (or any period we agree on)

  - We measure health when they start trying to lose weight and again 6 months (or any period we agree on) later

  - Claim: the number of people whose health rating has increased will be higher than the number of people whose health rating has decreased by a statistically significant amount.

Caveats:

  - We assume, incorrectly, that past performance implies future performance. Changes in medicine (perhaps in particular the advent of Ozempic) could change results.

  - We only look at people who are obese or overweight and are trying to lose weight. We do NOT look at:

- people who are obese or overweight and lose weight incidentally without trying

- people who are not obese or overweight but are trying to lose weight (eg, anorexics and bulimics but also others)

  - We do not cherrypick: the hypothesis applies to all overweight or obese people trying to lose weight. After obtaining results, we will not try to claim the result applies to a subset of the population we've selected.

Do you agree that this is our hypothesis?",

I realize these are only my opinions, and that not everyone who supports Trump is a libertarian. Others might believe that what Trump did happens all the time and that Trump was targeted for selective enforcement to harm his campaign. Still others may believe that, despite the jury selection process, it's difficult or impossible to get a fair jury in such a heavily Democrat controlled county. There are even a few people who would argue that, if he makes a good President, his personal life is irrelevant. And, of course, there's the appeals process.

More than sexual objects, sure. Prostitutes and those working in pornography don't do so 24/7. As for their bodies should and shouldn't be used for, you sound like those people who said women shouldn't work outside the home because it's degrading to them, regardless of how they feel about it.

Do you feel women aren't intelligent or moral enough to make their own decisions about pornography and prostitution? In what other ways do you want to control their bodies?

Well, I didn't really. It'd just more understandable if you were a member of a strong misogynist religion and had difficulty accepting women's rights. Not right or good, but at least more understandable.

Yes you are. It's like saying Black people commit crime. That's certainly a true statement, but it demonizes Black people because you are singling them out. Factual information can be biased.

At the very least, you should preface any negative statement about porn with multiple general positive statements, and with an explanation that anything and everything in life has dangers. However, even then, deciding to speak about the negative (not positive) qualities of a specific thing (not all things) is a form of bias.

Can you source this? I thought most social media rejected promotions for pornography, at least the way it's normally defined.

Didn't you say porn was bad because it gave people unrealistic expectations? How's that different from misinterpreting any other fiction?

Absolutely not. People have the right to negotiate and contract with each other without government interference.

> If your business cannot manage to pay what the labor of an American worker is worth

In a free market system, workers are automatically paid what they're worth. The problem is that the value of the labor of an unskilled American worker to a company is almost zero, and probably far less than living wage. I think you mean businesses should pay what YOU think the American worker is worth, but that's not really relevant.

Why not? To be fair, I believe Michael Jackson was innocent and was really just trying to show kids a good time, not molest them. Of course, ideally, you'd have a few extra adults around to confirm nothing sexual happened, but that's more because of what society things these days.

For me, it would depend on what they did. And, if you accept the concept that people are let out of jail after they are reformed, working a job could be the best thing for them. Some states even prohibit discrimination against people who have been formerly imprisoned, though I don't think that's the case here.

True, but this is Reddit. Pointless bickering is the whole point.

I am indeed saying ""I know for an almost fact there's no good scientifically valid evidence of global warming, and I will therefore challenge anyone who claims there is"".

I am implying that the only direct way to determine if global warming is occurring is to first find a testable definition of global warming (which itself isn't easy), and then actually perform the test. That's the experimental part of the scientific method that I think global warming theorists are omitting.

My general comeback to replies is that we simply don't have enough temperature data (not model data) to determine whether the Earth has been warming long-term. Even if we do get accurate data, we have to consider random variation.

So, if you have actual good scientific evidence of global warming, please present it.",

Examples (based on earlier comments):

  - The research showing vaccines cause autism has been discredited. However, no one has proven that vaccines 100% don't cause autism, and I don't think you could even design an ethical experiment to prove this

  - The 2020 election was most likely not rigged. All elections have some degree of fraud, but, even if there had been no fraud, the results would likely have been the same. However, it would be very difficult to actually prove 100% that the results wouldn't have been different if there were no fraud. Again, I don't even see a reasonable experiment you could perform to test that.

  - To show guns cause or prevent crimes, you'd again have to design an experiment where two randomly selected populations are identical except for the number of guns. Again, not an experiment that could be performed in real life.",

  - It's easier nowadays to report smaller disasters and disasters in unpopulated areas. Historically, only large disasters in populated areas were reported. We'd need to adjust for this change. Also, the further back we go in history, the less information is preserved, and we must adjust for that as well

  - We need to make sure we list all disasters even remotely related to climate. Cherrypicking disasters that have increased in quantity while ignoring those that have decreased would be biased

  - We need to determine the mean and standard deviation of the number of each disaster to make sure we're not just seeing random fluctuation.

  - We need to weight disasters by severity, but carefully. For example, an earthquake today may kill more people because population is higher, but still be lower on the Richter scale than a historical earthquake

  - Because our ability to measure pheomena accurately has increased, we need to adjust for lower precision in the fast. We also cannot assume the errors balance out since lack of precision doesn't always have a mean of zero.",

I know there's more to what you linked but 40 is a very small sample size and the fact that fewer than 50% completed the study invalidates even those results.

But let me go back to my original question: what sort of experiment would show whether or not weight loss results in increased overall physical and mental health? Before finding studies, at least figure out what the study SHOULD do.

I'm also going to cheat slightly and ask a different question: does *attempting* to lose weight increase or decrease health? Here, I would argue that people who lose a lot of weight and gain it back (the most common outcome of weight loss attempts) actually end up less healthy than before since rapid weight loss is dangerous.

Finally, even if you could show that, historically, weight loss has in general resulted in increased health, how can you show it will help a given individual without looking at other factors?",

Not always. Some scientific theories are based on very little evidence that can not be reproduced. Almost anything dealing with prehistory (all the way back to the alleged Big Bang) can't really be reproduced.

A bigger problem is that there are many theories that can explain the same set of facts, and science canonizes one or two of them ignoring the near-infinite other possibilities.

I understand people collect and curate data. Not all of this data is accurate because of instrument inaccuracies (including poor siting) and some of the data has been modified years after being measured, and I'm not convinced these cancel out. In other words, we have data, some of which is inaccurate

However, even if we have/accept accurate date, I'm primarily disagreeing with the conclusion that this shows global warming is occurring. That's where my ""spreading misinformation"" comment comes in. Some overly simplified examples:

  - ""The temperature in Denver is 50F and the temperature in New York is 42F. Therefore, the average temperature in the USA is 46F."". Bad geographic conclusion reached from factual data

  - ""Yesterday, the high in Denver was 52F. Today it is 53F. Therefore the high temperature in Denver is increasing 1F per day"". Bad time-based conclusion reached from factual data

When I asked for a definition of global warming, I meant a scientifically testable one, not something as vague as the UN's definition.

I don't believe in googling in situations like this because google gives too many answers. If there's a specific experimental paper you'd like me to look at that lists its methodology, I can skim it. Generally, the methodology is weak.

If you want to end this (but why, we're having so much fun), I should point out I reject most statistical conclusions reached by most papers (large categories of exceptions apply) because I feel the data is obtained or interpreted incorrectly. I sometimes colloquially say ""I don't believe in statistics"". That might be reason enough for you to stop answering me.",

Well, as many as 10% disagree and that's just in the very tightly defined field. Once you move to related fields, that disagreement gets higher. And that's actually the number of papers (if I remember correctly), not the number of researchers

I also disagree with the consensus number itself because I believe that study was ALSO done incorrectly, and the actual number (across multiple fields) may be lower.

I actually do know how they estimate historic global temperature (using gridding to avoid clustering issues) but they're using discrete non-randomly-sampled time and space data, so there's no way the result can be accurate. Combine that with new stations being built all the time, and gets even worse.

My goal was to show there is no statistical method that can use the existing data to come up with historical average global temperature. I was hoping the generic statement ""it's impossible with given data"" would cover the (incorrect) way they actually do it.

I am aware of climate modeling to estimate global temperature, but models depend heavily on assumed initial conditions. I'm convinced that, with a little tweaking, someone qualified (not me) could create models that show the Earth is cooling, because I believe models like these are chaotic in the sense they're subject to the butterfly effect

I also know we're getting better at using satellites to determine air temperature, but that's very recent.

The correct way to estimate global temperature over a day is to either have a tight grid of continuously reporting stations (probably impossible) or take and monitor a large but fixed random sample. We've done neither.

The problem I was hoping to avoid was having to ""prove a negative"". I've listed some ways climatologists could try to measure global temperature and why they don't work. However, I can't list every possible theoretical method. What I'm saying is the data available is insufficient to determine global temperature. 

From what you said about comparing two numbers to determine increase, I don't think you understand time series data well enough to discuss it (unless you were deliberately grossly oversimplifying). You need to talk about things like mean and standard deviation and goodness of fit

I have also looked at papers that claim 90% agree: some of them look for phrases like ""global warming"" in papers while ignoring ""global cooling"" (a concern in the 70s), ""global temperature change"", ""global climate trends"", and other phrases that might show papers disagreeing with global warming. They also limit their search to a narrow field, even though other related fields (and purely statistical analyses) might exist and shed doubt on global warming.

You're also making arguments based on ""the majority agree"" or ""an expert said it but without explanation"", both of which are logical fallacies.

Finally, maybe you're right in saying I'm not addressing your points, because I'm not sure what those points are.",

Actually, I think you've made my point for me. If I buy 1 lottery ticket (do something minor to lose weight), it doesn't cost much but I probably won't get much either.

If I buy 50K lottery tickets (make a vigorous effort at weight loss), it costs a lot more AND I'll still probably not win the big money.

I'd argue most people who try to lose weight long-term don't, and the pain/effort they make is just wasted. If I'm going to not win the lottery, I want to spend $1, not $50K.

I'll go further and argue that even people who successfully lose weight and keep it off may be ultimately worse off than if they'd never lost weight. I don't buy into the whole ""fat people are jolly"" thing, but a drastic change in lifestyle isn't always a good thing

Yes, that's what I'm saying expect for the ""completely random mystery"" part. We know quite a bit about how the human body works and that's useful for medical procedures and prescription medication.

I'd disagree. ""Challenges"" is a nice way of saying ""disagrees"", and disagreeing with someone means you are starting an argument.

I understand some people enjoy disagreeing and discussing alternative viewpoints, but, ultimately, that's still arguing. You can call it ""debate"" or ""adversarial discussion"" or whatever, but it's ultimately the same thing.

Some people are happy to do it, others feel their opinion is the only correct one. The latter will argue with you. I'd say most people are pretty stubborn in terms of believing their opinion is the only right one and will argue with anyone who disagrees.

There's probably some studies somewhere that show once you express an opinion, you have more of a stake in defending it than if you just hold it but don't say anything.",

What's a ""librarian""? OK, OK, I know, but very few people use libraries these days.

So it's basically the emotion I associate with each:

  - Influencer: happy fun life

  - Healthcare worker: sickness

  - Teacher: pedantic, boring, tyrannical

  - Librarian: huh?",

And, if non-racial data (estimated age, height, weight, gender, etc) is available and the officer ignores it, the officer is maliciously racist.

There's also the issue of past performance doesn't imply future performance and the balancing factor that, if Black people are convicted of more crimes per capita, there should be fewer Black criminals on the street than White criminals per capita, so you should chase the White people.

I actually believe public education is the CAUSE of stupidity, not the cure. Keep in mind that ending public education means people get that money back: it doesn't just go away. So people can use that money to create or pay for private schools that teach the values they want, not some government imposed ""truths"".

> Every country has elements of socialism

Yes, and my point is less socialism = more freedom. And since US has the least socialism, we are the freest.",

Sure, but it might be false insight. Our theories are based on observations, and, the fewer the observations, the less valid the insight. Physics and chemistry are hard sciences and pretty solid. But when it comes to things like medicine, sociology, and other soft sciences, not so much

No, you're cherrypicking and showing nonrepresentative examples that suggest global warming is occurring when it's not. You asked a biased question that assumed global warming was occurring and then asked people for examples. You didn't request a balanced view and therefore didn't get one.

> scientists have been measuring and studying climates around the globe for decades and have been noticing measurable differences in climate activity and temperature and that regardless of this data gathering that you don’t “believe in” (and then claiming that you will only pay attention to empirical evidence, which obviously you do not)

I don't believe any of this is true. Show me what statistically valid empirical evidence we have of global warming. I do believe most applied statistics is done very poorly, and thus believe the small amount of nonrepresentative (deceptive) information that does exist proves nothing.",

You could argue it makes sociology less accurate, but I'll go further and say many sociological experiments are so poorly done that the results are meaningless.

Science requires theories based on observations, and, if you don't have good observations, you can't create a scientific theory. So, in that sense, yes, sociology is unscientific.
