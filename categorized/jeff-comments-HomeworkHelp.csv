`x * x = x^2`. Now that you have `x^2` you can multiply it by itself to get `x^2 * x^2 = x^4` with only one extra multiplication. Similarly for `x^8`, `x^16` and `x^32`. That's 5 multiplications so far. Then `x^32 * x^16 * x^8 * x^4 * x^2` to get `x^62`. Unfortunately, that's 9 multiplications, but hoping it helps give you the general idea",

I'd say go ahead and take the square root as solving `(a+bi)^2 = something`. I don't know if you've looked up the answer, but it's really simple, so I was thinking De Moivre would be overkill",

At first, it seems like `f(4)` might be undefined because we have a division by `x-4`. However, that division only occurs because we divided by `x-4`: `f(x)` itself may still be defined at `x=4`. If we multiply both sides by `x-4`, we get:

`f(x) = q(x)(x-4) + 5`

Now, if x=4, we have `f(4) = q(4)*(4-4) + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5`.",
