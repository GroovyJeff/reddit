And many ""normal"" people are scared of crypto and will want to pay via bank card. But, if you accept bank cards and people lose money, they'll file chargebacks. Running a monetized gambling site is not easy.",

Many Python libraries are just C libraries compiled into Python (no point reinventing the wheel). And `C` will probably always be the fastest-running language.

I personally hate Python and use Julia, which satisfies your criteria and is fairly fast, but has other issues.",

Certificates and degrees get you past a filter. Employers get way too many resume's and want to minimize the number of interviews. Certificates and degrees are easy trusted evidence of capability. Your piles of evidence would be harder to go through and unnecessary because they already have too many candidates.

My advice: try using your ""social network"" (including parents, friends, neighbors, etc) and see if they know someone (or know someone who knows someone) who is looking for your skills and is willing to interview you.",
