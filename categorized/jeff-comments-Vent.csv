So let's move on to the concept of labor. To provide everyone with ""basic needs"", would have you have to force some people to labor for the benefit of others? I'm sure some would do so voluntarily but others wouldn't without compensation. Do you see a way of meeting everyone's ""basic needs"" without enslaving people?

I didn't address it earlier, but the other point is somewhat valid too: if you give birth to a child knowing that you won't be able to care and provide for it, that could be considered a form of child abuse. While I'm not suggesting mandatory abortion, I think people have a moral responsibility not to reproduce when they know their children will suffer.",

Both incest and rape fantasies are common and harmless and can start once you're old enough to masturbate, which can be as young as 9.

The number of tabs you have open isn't a good indicator. How many hours a day (or week) do you spend looking at porn and does it negatively effect the rest of your life?

OK, that's a passive voice statement. Explain how something like this would happen. Who is meeting those needs and how? Some people are charitable, but, in general, why would people provide food, education and medical care without compensation?
