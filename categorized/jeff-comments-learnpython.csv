`IF B IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN SET A TO 4 ELSE SET A TO 7` is a much longer way to say the same thing (I'm mimicking COBOL but this code may not be 100% valid), but presumably a lot easier to read for humans. That ""easier to read"" is the syntactic sugar (makes code prettier for us humans).

A milder example is some languages use `begin` and `end` (syntactic sugar) to offset code blocks, whereas others use `{` and `}`.",

The string $5$.8eHlM5ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP.ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP appears to be a hashed password using the SHA-512 crypt algorithm. Here’s a breakdown of its components:

    $5$: Indicates the use of the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.
    .8e: Part of the salt used in the hashing process.
    HlM5ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP: The actual salt value.
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP: The hashed password.

This format is commonly used in Unix-like systems for storing hashed passwords in the /etc/shadow file. The salt helps to protect against rainbow table attacks by ensuring that identical passwords hash to different values.

Edit: I'm assuming you altered the string length since ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP"" is not long enough to be a SHA-256 hashed string",
