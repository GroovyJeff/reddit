Quoting:

> Global Networks Switzerland AG announces this clarification to its recent communication
regarding the country code and associated identification code for networks +882 34. This network
code was assigned in accordance with section 8 of ITU-T Recommendation E.164.1. It is not a country
code for geographic areas as defined in section 7 of ITU-T Recommendation E.164 and section 6 of
ITU-T Recommendation E.164.1. The code has been assigned to Global Network Services for the
exclusive purpose of providing mobile telephony services to the few areas of Antarctica where
scientists live. These numbering resources will be used exclusively to provide services to subscribers in
those geographic areas of Antarctica. It should be noted that the network code +882 34 is totally
unrelated to the country code +672 (Australian External Territories including Australian Antarctic
Territory and Norfolk Island). Country code +672 should not be confused with the new network code
+882 34. In order to make the new services available, the network code +882 34 needs to be made
reachable worldwide. Thus, we request all operators to implement this network code.",
