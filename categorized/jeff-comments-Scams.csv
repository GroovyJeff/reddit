This is a pretty common scam, and you even see people on Reddit advertise for ""chatters"": people who pretend to be the girl and pretend to live in the same city as you. In some cases, they (the fake girl) actually does live in the same city so ""she"" will be as familiar with the city as you are. So, the person scamming you wasn't even the onlyfans girl herself.",
