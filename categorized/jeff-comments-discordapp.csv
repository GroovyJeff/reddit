Your OP said ""appears to be promoting illegal content"" which seems weaker than what you're saying now. Are they actually posting CP? Linking to websites with CP? Advertising CP services? Or what exactly? Of course, since you've already reported to Discord and the FBI, no need to tell us here, I'm just curious why you said ""promoting"" instead of ""posting"" or being more specific.

I also assume by ""multiple people participating"" you mean multiple people participating in CP, not just that you believe adult orgies are illegal

What is your view towards adult porn overall? I assume you're in support of it. If not, your reporting ""illegal content"" may be tainted by your immoral anti-porn view",
