I believe private businesses have the right to hire whomever they choose, and discrimination based on political view is neither illegal nor immoral.

Of course, you could easily game the system by pretending to be an American patriot and apply since there will probably be fewer applicants based on the company feeling patriotism is important enough to put in a job description.

Then, find a religious reason to stop being a patriot and see what they do.",
