They presumably exist to help you learn and understand subjects at a deeper level, not just prepare you for a job.

The not simple answer is a figurative black hole: people have been questioning why big name universities charge so much when they don't even prepare you for a job. If you follow this line of thinking, you start off realizing our education system is very seriously broken, and end up realizing that our entire civilization is pretty much based on lies.",

1. `error messages -> program is wrong` does not mean `program is wrong -> error messages`. If it's raining there will be clouds (usually), but if there are clouds it doesn't always mean rain.

2. `r and s are rational -> r+s is rational`. That does not apply the ""opposite"": if r+s is rational it doesn't mean r and s are rational.

Reading the rest of the article and assuming Sloot actually had something, I think Sloot's system was something similar to ""hashing"", the same thing bittorrent uses. Hash collisions (two different files having the same hash) does occur, but is rare, even in shorter hashes such as sha512 (64 bytes). With a well-chosen 8000-byte hash, and even allowing for the birthday paradox, you could easily assign a ""probably unique"" number to each file.

I will check the code you've written as well, but Sloot seems to be saying ""if two computers have the same file, you only need to transfer a small amount of information to retrieve the file on the 2nd computer"". Since we can now search millions of computers for that one file (bittorrent), this almost makes sense: if a file has been created and someone has it and is willing to share it, you can almost certainly find it just by its hash",

Though it's not listed on the linked page, I know there's at least one multi-bzip2'd file than expands to `10^100` bytes but is itself only a few bytes.
