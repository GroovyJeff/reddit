To avoid being slaughtered, lepercons started claiming they each lepercon had a pot of gold they kept hidden at the end of a rainbow. The Irish, being not only cannibalistic but also greedy, suppressed their urge to eat the little bastards and instead followed them to the end of the rainbow.

Once they reached the end of the rainbow, the lepercon did indeed hand them a pot of gold.
