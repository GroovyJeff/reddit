For example, if your variables were `x`, `y`, and `z`, you'd compute terms like `xy`, `xz`, `yz` moving up to things like `x^2yz`, `xy^2z`, `xyz^2`, and so on. You can do this algorithimically by considering all terms whose exponents sum to n as n increases. Once you've computed these variables, do a standard best fit linear regression.

You'll eventually get an accurate enough fit, but you may also want to look at the terms to see if they form a pattern that matches a  well-known power series or something",
