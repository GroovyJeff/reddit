I disagree with your PEDMAS comment since the adjacency operator (`2x` instead of `2*x`) does not have a well defined precedence. You could argue it's just multiplication, but I think people will still find `x/2y` ambiguous.",

Ideally, calculus would get people more interested in higher math, but, for now, the ironic answer is: calculus will be the hardest topic you'll see in math if it makes you quit doing math (self-fulfilling prophecy). If you get past calculus, there are many topics in math that are much harder (including plenty of highly specific unsolved problems), but also a lot more interesting.",
