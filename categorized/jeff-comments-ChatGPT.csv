But also, if you're saying AI will make decisions as good as the ones I make, that's a very weak argument given that you disagree with me.

The only way to really fix AI is to explain to it EVERY logical fallacy and EVERY statistical fallacy, and tell it to ignore any argument or decision that is based on a fallacy. That'll essentially lobotomize it to where it can't make any decisions at all, because when you get right down to it, there are no fundamentally correct decisions.

No, I think I am correct and you are left-wing, whereas you doubtless think you are correct and think of me as right-wing. That's how relative bias works: we assume we're the ""normal"" one.

Let's say you *believe* you have very high standards for objectivity, but, based on the rest of your message, I don't agree with you.

> excellent job at structuring their content policies to favor neutral language and factual reporting

Agreed. However, those policies are ignored or actively violated, so that doesn't really help.

> right wing politics have dipped hard into populist rhetoric that doesn't really align with the objective information coming out of academic sources

I don't think academic sources necessarily provide objective information (though there are a lot of schools out there, so I don't think either of us should generalize), but let's go through your examples

> Trump is lying

Trump isn't necessarily lying. It's possible he honestly believed there was voter fraud and was expressing his honest opinion

> there's no evidence of voter fraud

False. Every election has some degree of voter fraud. Ultimately, there wasn't enough evidence of voter fraud to overturn the election.

Lack of evidence isn't evidence of lack. It's possible there actually was enough fraud to overturn the election, but no one found enough evidence

> presenting only the verifiable facts.
