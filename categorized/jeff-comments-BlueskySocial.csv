When you reported the initial harassment to police, what did they say?",

From their perspective, they're just commenting on your posts, which is what social media is about

You said the Twitter harassment included threats to your family which are illegal (I assume you reported them to police), but have they done so on BlueSky? You also say ""the group of people this account appears to be from"", but that's a bit sketchy. Do you have any good evidence these are the same people?",

I'm getting a little suspicious and wanting to ask what you're advocating for that's drawing so much hate. Not saying it's your fault, but would be good to know",
