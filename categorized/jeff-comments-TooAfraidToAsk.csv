You could argue that sexual intercourse is implicitly private and that Stormy Daniels had no right to reveal that she had sex with Donald Trump, meaning Donald Trump is actually the victim of blackmail and that Stormy Daniels should be prosecuted.

Leaving that aside, I believe Donald Trump had the right to pay Stormy Daniels hush money. Joking aside, Trump is a rational human being (and has lawyers), so he would've done this in the most straightforward way possible. Apparently, some bad laws prevented him from doing so. Every other ""crime"" he committed (in this situation) was to assert his right to pay Stormy Daniels and work around bad laws, so I don't have a problem with it. I can't see any reason that Donald Trump, advised by lawyers, would break any laws unnecessarily.

I don't remember enough about the sexual assault charges to comment on them. I think that might go beyond the scope of this question though (the OP technically said ""crimes"", not ""civil actions"").

It's called depreciation, the decrease in value of items the company owns (both goods for sales and supplies/equipment). They can write off depreciation against profits, and thus pay less in taxes.

Why not just sell the goods at market value? Because the IRS allows depreciation to be calculated in a way that taxes on the loss value are reduced by more than the fair market price. In other words, if a company could sell items at $100, it might be able to depreciate them for $700 and save $200 in taxes, coming out ahead.",

Do you have a source for this? I'm not saying it's not true, but the Pew research report I vaguely remember reading suggests otherwise, especially for Muslims who live outside countries that observe sharia law.

Even if you could show the majority harbor extremist views, it would be wrong to judge an individual person solely by their religion. You have to consider all factors about that and not assume they are identical or even similar to other people who share (or claim to share) their religion.

This is really problematic because, while we love and respect our grandparents and ancestors, they often have views that were acceptable at the time (Blacks should drink from different water fountains and attend different schools), but no longer are.

It sort of does. If the majority of Black people believe something (and you seem to be suggesting more than just a majority), that's a lot of people. So you'd have to ask why liberals, who want to help minorities, would oppose that view. Generally, when you want to help people, you agree with their opinions.

I could make up an example. Suppose Black people, weakened by all the Cherry Coke[1] they drink, decide they want to be slaves again. Then you could see where the liberals would try to lift them up and convince them they have value. But there probably isn't enough Cherry Coke[1] in the world for that

> I've worked with a lot of students from Asia and found them to be infinitely more respectful and polite than their western counterparts

Asian culture is different from Western culture in many ways, so you can't attribute this difference to just corporal punishment.

Kids generally NEED to rebel to some degree to grow, and excessive respect and politeness towards adults can lead to covering up abuse: kids still need to speak out against bad parents and bad teachers.

> a child is being a little shit

This sounds like you're extremely angry at children and not like you're making a valid argument. I'm not sure why you chose to phrase it this way.

> teachers are unable to do their jobs because of the awful behaviour of young people.

I believe public education is really a form of imprisonment for students where they're forcefed useless or inaccurate knowledge and propoganda, and that teachers are mostly bad people who harm children. So teachers not doing their ""jobs"" is a good thing. At the same time, I do believe parents have the right to raise their children how they want, and thus the right to send their children to public school, but I can also understand why children rebel against public education.

> what they think the alternatives to physical discipline are?

This is the weakest part of your argument. Not even our prison system uses physical discipline. Non-violent restraint (forcing a child to remain in a room or an area and not use any entertainment devices) is a good alternative to corporal punishment. Because non-violent restraint may require some physical actions (such as picking the child up or barring a door), it's still a form of ""physical discipline"" but not the same thing as ""corporal punishment"".

To me, the only valid argument for corporal punishment is to remind kids that violence really is the ultimate answer. For the most part, we don't solve problems like slavery or genocide by putting people on the naughty step. Ultimately, we do need war and physical violence and no one should say ""violence is never the answer"". However, violence should be a last resort, and, despite what you say, it sounds like you want to use it a lot, not just in a few specific cases. But, ultimately, kids need to learn that, if they continue to disregard people's rights, they will be met with violence.",
