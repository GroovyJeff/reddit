> In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, streaming media company Roku, Inc. revealed that around a quarter of the company's cash reserves—$487 million—were held by SVB.[114] Other companies affected by the collapse include video game developer Roblox Corporation, video hosting service Vimeo,[115] and payroll processor, Rippling.[116][117]

so you may have a point, but these look like corporate holdings, not individual holdings. I'm not sure why these companies thought putting more than the FDIC-insured amount into a bank account was a good idea, but they did get reimbursed so I guess it worked out for them.

I'd still argue that MOST of the CEOs' multi-billion dollar wealth is based on their stock holdings, and, as others have hinted, if they actually tried to convert it to cash, they'd get a lot less since the price would fall as they sold off their stock, perhaps even before they did since they have to announce sales and purchases in advance",
