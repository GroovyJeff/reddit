In theory, you could run ""fat"" executables (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary) on a machine without bloatware, although the executables would be larger, and you'd ultimately have multiple copies of the same library inside different executable files. Despite this, I support fat executables because they're like Docker (and Python's ""env"") and tend to run consistently than executables using shared libraries.

Most people don't create fat executables, though there might (?) be a market for fattening executables by recompiling them with a fixed set of libraries",

    Patent law defines the limits of what can be patented. For example, the laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot be patented, nor can only an idea or suggestion

More realistically, even Thomas Edison said genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. It's highly unlikely that your idea, in and of itself, is worth a billion dollars. I'd suggest just sharing it and you'll find others have done it before, possibly better than you can do it.

If you don't want to take my advice, hire a lawyer to draft a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that anyone would have to sign before you shared your idea. The lawyer should advise you that NDA's aren't 100% protection and don't cover everything",
