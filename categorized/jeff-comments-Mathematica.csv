So it may've been fixed later. Thanks re IntegerQ, it just surprised me a little",

I realize removing the conditional changes things, but thought this might help.

Note that you only have phik in the `2 f^2 (-Log[Sin[phik/(2 f)]]` term, so you can move all the other terms to one side, divide by `2f^2`, `Exp` the result, `ArcSin` that result and multiply by `2f` to get phik by itself",

Remember that Mathematica has its own language (the Wolfram language) separate from what wolframalpha can parse. Try something like:

`Sum[Floor[x+y/27],{y,1,180}] == 500`

Now, if you wrap Solve around it:

`Solve[Sum[Floor[x+y/27],{y,1,180}] == 500]`

nothing happens because Mathematica can't solve that, but you get the idea.

Graphing shows the function on the left jumps from 499 to 506 near -0.075, so I don't think there's a solution",

`floor(x+27/27) = 1 + floor(x)`

`floor(x+54/54) = 2 + floor(x)`

Notice the terms `floor(x+27/27)` and `floor(x+54/27)` are missing from your long sum after Mathematica simplifies is.",
