When I was growing up, you weren't supposed to have a good time at work. Work was something you tolerated in order to get money so you could have a good time when you were not working. If you enjoyed your job, that was just a bonus.

You also got paid more to be subordinate, not just for your skills. For example, I'm retired and code for fun, but wouldn't want to code for money again because that means I'd have to do it THEIR WAY. Or, to be a bit more crude, you get paid to take their shit.

I think the real solution is for more people to start their own businesses, not focus solely on price and try to convince customers to pay more because you treat your workers better. If everyone just wants the lowest prices, we'll keep seenig what we're seeing now",

Legally, I doubt posting a job constitutes a legal contract, but it may constitute a legal promise (that this position exists) and may thus be actionable.

It's unlikely anyone actually spends the majority of their time or even the majority of their waking life at work. I'd argue that some amount of work actually benefits mental health, though I empathize with you that a job like yours probably doesn't.

I do support voluntary euthenasia and it would have the effect of reducing the workforce making remaining individuals more valuable. However, thanks to AI, it might be too late.",
