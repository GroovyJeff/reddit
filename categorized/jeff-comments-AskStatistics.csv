It's a psuedo-science that makes predictions that have no basis in reality or mathematics, but people keep using it because bad knowledge is better than no knowledge.

Well, approximately. Some studies are done well and yield useful results, but many don't. And the media tends to sensationalize the results of studies regardless of how badly they've been designed or performed.

Statistics leads to things like racial profiling, and AI, instead of being neutral, just parrots the statistical biases we give it.

Even ignoring the ""past performance doesn't imply future performance"" and ""correlation doesn't imply causation"" issues that many studies have, I believe there is inherent bias in how we categorize people (and other entities) that invalidates studies.

I'm particularly annoyed when this psuedoscience is used to determine insurance rates or otherwise harm people in real life.",

Observational research relies on correlation implying causation which it often doesn't. And it's even possible that a correlation between X and Y means Y implies X even if you're hoping to claim X implies Y.

I also disagree with you about randomized trials. Your inclusion criteria should be stated as part of the study (eg, ""this study applies to males 40 to 50 years old living in the state of Wyoming""). I'm not sure what you mean by pragmatic elements: could you give an example. And I'd say using a method that guarantees one fewer error does make it better.",

This seems impossible. What if one variable is a complex high level polynomial (or even a many-termed Fourier series) of another? At some point, that would be indistinguishable from the two variables being independent of each other.

You can check for correlation for a given family of functions of functions meeting a certain criteria, but I don't think you can check, even implicitly, for *any* type of dependence. If nothing else, any finite data series can be interpolated by a polynomial",

What is their percentage chance of winning a game? The obvious guess would be 70%, but let's instead ask: if the Reds had a `p` chance of winning a game, what's the chance they'd win 7 out of 10. The answer is `Binomial[10,7]*p^7*(1-p)^3`, where Binomial is the binomial coefficient (""10 choose 7"").

If you graph this function, it does peak at 70%, but if you average by taking `Integrate[p*f[p], {p,0,1}]/Integrate[f[p],{p,0,1}]`, you'll see the answer is 8/12 (which simplifies to 2/3).

In general, if there are k successes out of n trials, the average of the integral will be `(k+1)/(n+2)`.

Not sure if this helps, but it's how I got started on Bayesian probability",

In any sort of continuous problem, the chance `p = 0.35` is probably zero and you'd HAVE to look at an interval around 0.35. A discrete distribution where `p = 0.35` isn't impossible, but is more of a special case.",
