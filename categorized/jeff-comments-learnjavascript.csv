I'm sure there's a measurable answer out there re whether AI is decreasing entry-level jobs, but I'm too lazy to look for it

On the factual part, we could just look at new developer hires, overall salary changes adjusted for inflation, etc, to see if coders are more or less in demand. I'm saying we'd find coders are now less valuable (less demand), but, of course, that doesn't explain why. Or I could be wrong completely and coders are becoming more valuable.

I don't use AI much for coding, but, just for fun, had it write a counter, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer (three separate small programs), and it did a pretty good job. I doubt you could feed it a huge project right now, but potentially small chunks of projects (which, I would argue, is what senior programmers do to junior programmers)",
