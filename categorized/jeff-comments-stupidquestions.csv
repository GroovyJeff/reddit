Parliament did all sorts of terrible things, but no one really cared beause they provided the Brits with an endless supply of bad meat. Although the Brits raised cattle, they were allergic to steaks, high quality ground beef, and, indeed, any food with any sort of taste.

Parliament added corn to the beef and sent it back, but it turns out this still tasted too good. So they just dumped a ton of salt in it in the hope of dehydrating the Brits, but it instead turned them into pale-faced wide-eyed clown-makeup carictures.

You can convert calories to joules and watts are joules per second. The calculator https://www.reddit.com/user/National-Jackfruit32/ provides requires seconds as input as well.

Quoting the first random web link I found (https://www.fst.com/news-stories/magazine/renewable-energy/human-power-plant/)

> Humans are electrified in the truest sense of the word. With every step, muscle contraction and reaction in our cells, our bodies produce energy. At rest, the human body generates an average of 100 watts of output. During sports activities, it reaches 300 to 400 watts. That’s the equivalent of burning 2,000 calories a day. Or, from a different perspective, the energy used by an LED floodlight over a 24-hour period. The body itself uses a large share of the energy it produces: for thinking, for movement or for organs and cells. It even consumes energy at night. What’s left escapes into the environment as heat.

However, at least part of their math is bad:

`400 W = 400 J/s * 86400 s/day = 34560000 J/day * 1 kcal / 4184 J ~ 8260 cal/day`

It's possible they meant 100 watts of output while resting burns about 2000 cal/day, which is fairly accurate",

I mean, that's bad, but that's the problem you need to solve, not your coworkers whole life. You have a stake here because it's affecting you and your kids, but your stake is limited to stopping the stealing (and potentially getting reimbursement and having your coworker prosecuted, though that seems extreme). Trying to control someone else's entire life is not the answer.

Assuming they are only stealing food (and not money earmarked for food or something) and not reselling it, you could make the moral argument that, regardless of circumstances, anyone who steals food should be pitied not judged. He Gets Us.",
