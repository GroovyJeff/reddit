Your calculation is a bit off if you mean the same minute AND the same year. There were about 135.63 million people born in 1993 (https://ourworldindata.org/births-and-deaths) which works out to about 258 people per minute. There's no need to compensate for time zones since it's only 9:03am in a small part of the world at any given time, and the 258 represents the sum across all time zones.

So, there were about 258 people born the same minute as you. If we assume some doctors/hospitals round to the nearest 5 or even 15 minutes, the number of people whose birth certificate shows 9:03am exactly would be smaller.

Most of these people would still be alive, but given that there are 8 billion people in the world, only 1 in about 31 million would have the same birth minute as you. That works out to about 10 people in the USA.",

> This January felt like the honeymoon period for billionaires, who saw their wealth surge by $10 billion every day. One month later, the daydream is over, and their net worth is tanking.

As others note, these aren't real gains, just hypothetical stock gains. If billionaires actually tried to sell off their stock, they'd get much less than the current value times the shares they own. And, as above, if you gain money in January and lose it in March, your net annual gain will be small or zero",

Polygraph tests aren't necessarily statistically independent. If they were, even if they were only 51% accurate (or any number over 50), you could just have someone take them repeatedly until you met any required degree of accuracy.

However, if someone can lie successfully on a polygraph test today, they can probably do it again tomorrow and the next day and so on. And, if they can lie on a polygraph test more than 50% of the time, they'll eventually be acquitted, even if the tests are independent.

You could also argue that being forced to take a polygraph test violates the ""no self-incrimination"" rule in the Bill of Rights, so it could only be used if the defendant chooses to use it, which a defendant is more likely to do if they're innocent, meaning the false positive rate (accusing someone of lying when they're not) would be an issue",

Quoting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria#History

> Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of vampire and werewolf legends, based upon certain perceived similarities between the condition and the folklore.

> In January 1964, L. Illis's 1963 paper 'On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves' was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine. Later, Nancy Garden argued for a connection between porphyria and the vampire belief in her 1973 book Vampires. In 1985, biochemist David Dolphin's paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 'Porphyria, Vampires, and Werewolves: The Aetiology of European Metamorphosis Legends', gained widespread media coverage, popularizing the idea.[citation needed]
