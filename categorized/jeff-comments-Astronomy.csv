I always thought of the sidereal year as a period of time, not having a specific start or end date. However, quoting the wikipedia article:

>The Indian national calendar, based on the works of Maga Brahmins, as are the calendars of neighbouring countries, is traditionally reckoned by the Sun's entry into the sign of Aries and is also supposed to align with the spring equinox and have relevance to the harvesting and planting season and thus the tropical year.[citation needed] However, as the entry into the constellation occurs 25 days later, according to the astronomical calculation of the sidereal year, this date marks the South and Southeast Asian solar New Year in other countries and cultures

Basically, the March equinox occurs when the Sun reaches the ""first point of Aries"". However, because of precession, this point is actually closer to the Aquarius-Pisces border and quite far from today's IAU definition of Aries. April 14th is apparently the date the Sun enters Aries as it is defined today or somehow corrected for precession.",
