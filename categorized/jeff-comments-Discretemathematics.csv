Less than is an antisymmetric relation. If `x < y` it can never be the case that `y < x`.

Symmetric means `x R y -> y R x`. Equality is symmetric. If `x = y`, it is always the case that `y = x`

A relation like `<=` is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric. For example `4 <= 5` but `NOT (5 <= 4)`, so the relation isn't symmetric. However, `5 <= 5` and `5 <= 5`, so the relation isn't antisymmetric either. In other words, `x R y` doesn't imply `y R x` but it also doesn't imply `NOT (y R x)`.",
