That's not true. There are plenty of people who have clinical depression who haven't been diagnosed yet. Self-diagnosis isn't ideal, but it's not always wrong. Many people who self-diagnose as autistic (usually high functioning autism) ARE actually autistic but don't have or want a doctor's diagnosis since high-functioning autism doesn't necessarily always need treatment.

Instead of callously suggesting someone is faking depression, try being empathetic and suggesting a doctor's visit may help them obtain medication that can make them feel better.",
