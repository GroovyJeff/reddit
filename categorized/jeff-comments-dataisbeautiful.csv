My claim is that there so many *unknown* criteria, that it is impossible to do this balancing correctly.

At the very least, have a hostile party list the hundreds or millions of reasons your conclusions might be inaccurate based on your methodology

> tests are done to see if new results match the expectation from that criterion being significant

Now that might be valid. If you find a correlation by coincidence in an experiment, but then run a second indepedent experiment and get the same correlation, you can be far more confident its a real world phenomena.

However, if you're going to go down this route, I'm going to question whehter most social studies use anything resembling a random sample. Yes, true randomness is unattainable, but I'm guessing most studies aren't even close to random sampling the population on which they want to gather data.

So, we're applying human bias (by deciding on what factors we observe and which ones we ignore), collecting bad data, applying more human bias (by deciding which of the factors we chose to observe are and aren't relevant) and then applying bad logic (past performance implies future performance, extrapolation). That's not good.

BTW, I do appreciate your recognizing me as a mathematician (or at least as someone who knows some math) instead of treating me like a completely innumerate idiot (I may be an idiot, but at least I'm numerate!).

I should point out ""I don't believe in statistics"" is an exaggeration: I believe most social statistical studies are deeply flawed. I don't have a problem with medical studies on rats and stuff.

Something to consider: in a population of n people there are B(n) ways to partition them into subgroups, where B() is the Bell number. Mathematically, each of these partitions is equally valid. Some of them will have names in English like race, gender, nationality, etc, but most won't. However, the lack of an English name doesn't make these partitions any less important.

Any statistical sample you have, random or otherwise, that doesn't include the entire population, will have anamolies for many of the partitions. For example, if 5% of the US population is born in Texas, your sample may have only 3% born in Texas. You could, of course, adjust by counting the Texas-born votes with a weight of 5/3rds.

But now imagine you do that with every partition (there are issues here, but let's go with it for the moment). My claim is that you'll find your sample set, random or not, cannot fulfill the criteria of having the same distribution as every partition.

Therefore, if your sample IS randomly chosen, you must use it ""as is"" to prevent bias.

There are many factors that determine whether something (such as birth defects) will or will not occur. If we look at a single factor and ignore the others, we introduce a bias and our results are inaccurate. If we look at all the factors like we should, we'll find that, by symmetry, they tell us nothing.

Of course, past performance doesn't imply future performance either.
