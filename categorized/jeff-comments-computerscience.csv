This isn't true. The pigeonhole principle is a mathematically provable statement, and doesn't rely on how data is stored.

Basically, if you're going to compress one million different files, you're going to need one million different compressed files, because, if each original file is different, each compressed file must be different too",

That's one definition, but, as you point out, it's easy to meet that definition.

The statistical definition for, say, a random fair coin means that heads and tails are equally likely. I don't see any way you can prove that, and the concept may not even make sense.

If you accept the alternate timelines theory and could somehow show what happens in every other possible theoretical timeline, you may be able to show randomness.",
