However, you don't appear to be making any of these fallacies. You seem to be saying a small percentage of a large number can be a large number, and that's certainly true. Imagine how many hamburgers you could buy with 0.01% of the US debt (sorry, it's lunchtime)",

I'm not sure I follow re the standard error and propagation of errors re the mean. We might be using the word ""error"" in different ways.
