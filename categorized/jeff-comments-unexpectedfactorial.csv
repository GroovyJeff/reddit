  - `(200!)!!` semifactorial of 200 factorial

  - `(200!!)!` factorial of the semifactorial of 200

  - `((200!)!)!` the factorial of the factorial of the factorial of 200

  - `200!!!` something else entirely like `200 * 197 * 194 * ... * 2`

  - Meaningless because it's not a valid mathematical utterance",
